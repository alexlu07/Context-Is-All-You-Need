      <body>Idk if I ever told you but we are cage training the dog with exiting the cage... first, make him sit. Don't open cage door until he does. You can unlatch it but make him sit again... second, open the door stand in front of the opening and tell him to stay.... third, step aside and tell him to come.... if he runs out before you say to, put him back in and repeat</body>
