      <body>P.p.s.-I hope I didn't say the wrong thing earlier: just to clarify, hydrogen is special in chemistry because it is the only element that can exist without an electron; we refer to a hydrogen cation as a proton in solution, but a neutral hydrogen atom does contain one electron in it's outermost orbital (though it exists diatomically in nature in its gaseous state as 2 H atoms bonded by their respective electrons to form a lone electron pair).</body>
