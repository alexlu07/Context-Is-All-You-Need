      <body>Hey Chris. I actually basically quit my job. I might still be able to get u some random work, but I have some ideas for monetizing my art and potentially yours if u want to discuss.  Your expertise in pre-print would actually be crucial. Let's meet up.  I think I am mostly free Tuesday through Thursday this week</body>

      <body>Always up to meet up yeah. I've had a lot of ideas about monetizing my art lately too. My recent trips to China and the Middle East opened my eyes a lot. Let's get a coffee tomorrow. That's rad that the illustrator class worked out! It's so helpful. </body>
