      <body>Ah! Non-spicy: chicken korma (delicious cashew sauce). Otherwise anything tikka masala is a good intro, or tandoori if they prefer a smoked/grilled kind of thing</body>

      <body>It also depends on the type of restaurant you're at though. Northern Indian is a lot different than other styles, for example. I'd just ask for their suggestions for someone new to the cuisine :-)</body>
