      <body>Hey Gabi! I sent an email out on January 23rd with all of the things that you asked for. It just now bounced back. Probably the playbill file was too big. 
I just resent them in separate emails. Can you please let me know if you DONT get the email with the playbill? It's just the playbill on its own.
