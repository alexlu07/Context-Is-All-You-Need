      <body>Sewer. Also beware that osha has started sending out sentinels to inspect sites. Every 4' down that you dig requires shoring. Plumber I know got a fine for being at 5' without shoring - $30k!!!</body>

      <body>Vertical boards with cross bracing. Maybe keeping a pitch is fine. Dunno. But yeah $30k is insane. </body>

      <body>You mean keeping a pitch to your hole or putting in piles to hold the dirt wall? 30k is preposterous. I assumed I would get fined by l&amp;i but that it would be a fraction of what I would have to pay a plumber to actually do the work</body>

      <body>The best price I found for that work was "best choice plumbing". $4700 for digging under 15' of sidewalk and replacing concrete. Probably around $2k for you at this point since you've done half the work. </body>
