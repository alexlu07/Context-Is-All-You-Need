      <body>Well I have this idea for a collection of 5 short stories about different kinds of love. But I want to do a ridiculous and fun spin on it, and also make it a musical. So I was wondering if that's something you'd wanna help out with? </body>

      <body>Before you totally sign on though, we're thinking a sci fi musical. With vampires and werewolves and witches and fairies... But they all face relatable problems like unrequited love and teen angst and such. And I'm hoping to shoot in late May/early June... If that gives you a rough idea of what this is:) </body>
