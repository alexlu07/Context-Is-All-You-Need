      <body>Hi! I'm stranded in FL, and can't get a flight out until tomorrow. Unless tmrw's weather is bad too. I'm supposed to work at Beau Monde on Wed night and asked Arnie to drop your cash there. I'll keep ya posted. Hope you're enjoying the winter weather. It's in the 80's here!</body>

      <body>Not a bad place to be stranded all things considered. That sounds fine, but no rush to get me the money. Snows melting here so you should be able to return soon. Have a safe trip, see you soon</body>
