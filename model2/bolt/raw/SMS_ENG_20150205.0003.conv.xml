      <body>yes to day movies / i have no plans vday. Nate doesn’t get in to late saturday so i am free after i teach (should be home around 2). and nate wanted to see some Stanley Kubrick films but honestly, I don’t think I want to. Sunday is going to be my first day off in like two weeks. So I don’t know if I want to see Stanley Kubrick.. . but who knows. Would you want to see it?</body>
