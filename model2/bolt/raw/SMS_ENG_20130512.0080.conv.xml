      <body>Hey man, can I ask you for a medium-size favor that I might not actually need to take you up on? There is a small motorcycle I want to bid on eBay that's like nine miles away from you. If I win and the seller says I have to pick it up soon, like next weekend would you mind grabbing it for me? It's like the size of a dirt bike-ish. If not I completely understand.  Just exploring options....and if its worth it.</body>

      <body>Thanks man. I really appreciate it. I've been searching for one of these for like 2 years now and the guy doesn't even know what he has. Again, it might not even happened but just seeing options. It's a lil '74 Harley Sprint.</body>
