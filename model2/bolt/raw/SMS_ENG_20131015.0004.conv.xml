      <body>I'll just text it since you're probably working all night. I'm trying to sign you as a beneficiary to the life insurance plan that I am currently receiving from my employer. This is not related in any way to any school. In order to do this, I need your social. If you don't feel comfortable providing that, I'll just leave you off as a beneficiary. </body>
