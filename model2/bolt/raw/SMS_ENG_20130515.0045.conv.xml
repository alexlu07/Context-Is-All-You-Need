      <body>Hi! I am selling my fridge to Dela and Helen for their common room next year. I forgot that the one in my common room now is also technically mine. Do you and Julianne also want a fridge for next year? It freezes things sometimes so you have to keep it on setting 1. If so would you two be willing to pay me for it? (I am asking Dela and Helen for $40...if that's a problem let me know cause I want this to have a good home)</body>
