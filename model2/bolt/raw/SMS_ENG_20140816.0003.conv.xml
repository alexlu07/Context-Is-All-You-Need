      <body>Yup I am back in Ohio! Parents are giving me the basement to transform into a studio so I have been doing a lot of cleaning, organizing, and adding to my source material. My health is better and the medication so far is working for me! I started driving again since I have the seizures under control. Flying to Chicago August 30-September 8.  Are there any days between September 9 through September 24th when you are particularly free??! </body>
