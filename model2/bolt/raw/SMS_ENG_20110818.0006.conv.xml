      <body>It's enough to know you like it :) have you heard of king creosote and Jon hopkins? The album is diamond mine. I know how you feel about electronic stuff but it's minimal and the songs are gorgeous separately but altogether... It's over.</body>

      <body>Wonderful and awful.  Lots of time to stare out a bus window and listen to Nina Simone. Good shows, bad shows.  I do love the country rolling beneath me at 70 miles an hour for hours upon hours.  And driving through the night while the band sleeps.  Wonderful and awful.</body>
