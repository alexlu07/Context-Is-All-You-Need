      <body>Hey, are you good with taking the subway to the concert tomorrow? If we leave your place by 7 at the absolute latest and walk to the Broad Street Line, we can transfer to the MFL and take it all the way out to 69th street. Tower is about half a block from the station</body>

      <body>Are you just wearing jeans/sweater/coat/etc.? I know we'll be freezing our asses off walking but never been to the Tower so I am not sure if they have places to put stuff there. </body>

      <body>I haven't been there in ages, so I honestly have no idea if there's a coat check or anything. But yeah, probably just jeans, a sweater and a heavy coat. I'll sit on the coat if necessary.</body>
