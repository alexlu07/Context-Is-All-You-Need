      <body>So I was so mad last night. I put emmy in her crate around 11:40 and she barked until like 12:10. Damn half an hr of a low barking noise. The entire time I was trying to sleep and I was getting annoyed. So i finally said "emmy! Stop!" And she did, just like that. I was so mad cause if I had just said that after 5 mins, she probably would've stopped. </body>
