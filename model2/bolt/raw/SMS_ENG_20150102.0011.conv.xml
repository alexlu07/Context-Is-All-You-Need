      <body>Yeah that's great. I am trying to finish this guy up tonight, and frame it in the morning. It's the coyote skull that is the same size as the laser-cut you have. I tried 3 times to do a Lasercut of it but it would cut over the lines and fall apart every time. I'm going to do a hand cut edition of three. You and Zui have first dibs, if you want it, but I can't sell it for the same price as the other since it's taken me over two days to cut out just one of them and I still have to frame it. I'm not sure what my retail price will be for it but I could sell it to you for $400. I'll bring it up if I finish it in time so you can at least  see it and decide then</body>
