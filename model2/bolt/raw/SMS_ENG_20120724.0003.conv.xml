      <body>Well training pays minimum wage only and then they didn't get me on the schedule for a week and now the money I'm making won't be on a check until next pay day. I'm also looking at apartments and found the PERFECT place with the most PERFECT roommates. But i will need to pay first, last, and a deposit to move in on September first... That would be 1,725 on September first. I'll have to email you my plans but I may need more car money for that... </body>
