      <body>I just wanted to let you know before you hear it from anybody else who blows up the dramatic story that Poppie is okay but he is in the hospital. The infection in his leg got pretty bad. They are keeping him doped up so he sleeping mostly when he's awake he's a little disoriented and confused. At this point we think that he'll be able to come home within the next couple weeks But not certain. I will keep you posted if anything happens where his condition deteriorates</body>

      <body>It's been up-and-down on what they think the prognosis is whether he'll be able to come home and have a nurse take care of him or go to a nursing facility or if we should prepare for the worst they've kind of been all over the board so I don't want to tell you to come down when we don't really know yet</body>
