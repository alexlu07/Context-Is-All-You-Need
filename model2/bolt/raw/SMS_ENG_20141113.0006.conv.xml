      <body>If Beth is on the case we should be able to get rid of them once &amp; for all.  I wouldn't blame you if you were skeptical but while my confidence in Cindy is very low.  But I am sure Beth will get rid of them.  I don't think she has ever failed when treating for bedbugs or anything.  She is tenacious.  Cindy on the other hand.......  </body>
