      <body>Yeah for sure. The whole "party every weekend" mentality is getting old. Plus it's highly unsustainable. Once every few weeks ill stay in. Finals season is already kinda starting ahhhhh. And I feel like I'm just developing healthier habits for daily life like eating healthy and a gym routine, etc</body>
