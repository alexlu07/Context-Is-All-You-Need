      <body>Jenny's so focused on this thing having an attitude (which I probably wouldn't even pick out on my own) that she can't even see that it's a dog, not a bear. Haha. I would hate being around babies and their toys all day.</body>

      <body>Haha. I know, right? I love you too. Maybe they do just aim to superficially please each other by agreeing or making phony conversion. It's pretty sad that this dog/ bear is all that Jenny has to fret over.</body>
