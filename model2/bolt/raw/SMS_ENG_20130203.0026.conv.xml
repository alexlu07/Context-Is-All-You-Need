      <body>Ok so if we take the r5 and then the market Frankfurt line we will need to leave about 5:30ish. This way is slightly more expensive. If we take the r100 we can leave take the 5:30 or 6:00 and then the el. This way is cheaper but we need 6 one dollar bills. Also google maps is being a poop and refusing to tell me which r100 train we should take. </body>
