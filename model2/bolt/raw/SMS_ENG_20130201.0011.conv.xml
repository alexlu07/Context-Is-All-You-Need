      <body>Aw CB, you are so sweet. I meant to reply to this text and tell you how much I appreciate this. I learned how to needle lung 7 today and Della said she felt it connect to where colon 4 is! Entry/exit!!! There's so much to learn and know. But I love it. :)</body>

      <body>It was pretty great even if I didn't feel that. Needling is so scary and cool. If you miss the point the needle feels grating, like going into meet. If you get it, it slips in like butter!!!</body>
