      <body>Hey guys, I'm sorry this message is so late in the day. Since I didn't get any texts today, I assume no one is going out, which is ok I think because I've been trying to read the same 3 chapters for class for 2 days and it's just not sticking with me. I'm freaking out a bit because I've got to write a paper on it in a couple weeks and I've got no idea how to start. </body>
