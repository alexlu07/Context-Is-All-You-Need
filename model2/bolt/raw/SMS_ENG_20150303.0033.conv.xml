      <body>Jenna hm... I think so..
 aunt heidi is a great source for this gamma too:
on gampas side joseph Yonker and joseph artim.  on gammas side elmer mauger (old world german spelling Maucher with two dots over the a) and Mcguire (do not remember first name)..  Gottlieb Maucher (mauger) was in the civil war fought for the north and was caught and held in libby prison... A famous prison.... You could call Gamma.... and It would make her day </body>
