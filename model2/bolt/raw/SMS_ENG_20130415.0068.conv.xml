      <body>Hey, so I'm eating some of Danielle's leftover Spanish food from earlier and had an idea. There are actually some really sweet thrift &amp; antique stores here in Philly but we never really go to them cause they're kinda out of our normal safe zones.  .... Long story short, let's go to North/North East Philly, like Fishtown and above to jump around sweet spots....?? AAAnd I'll take you to this awesome awesome Puerto Rican food spot that I know of.</body>
