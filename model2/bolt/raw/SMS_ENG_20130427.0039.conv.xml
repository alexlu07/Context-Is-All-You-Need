      <body>Hey Liza! Yeah, for sure. I am just heading back to shore now. Should be on a train with time to talk at like 6/630. Does that work?</body>

      <body>Thank you so much! We actually already decided - we took the place at 44th and locust rather than Chestnut between 44th/45th. The one we decided against didn't seem quite as safe, which is what I was going to ask you about.</body>

      <body>Oh! What a great location. I would have said do locust over chestnut too!</body>
