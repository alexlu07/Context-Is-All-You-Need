      <body>Hey, i'm seriously considering putting Iliana in private school next year.   Im looking at open houses that are going on right now.  The general tuition look to be around 8-10k per year.  Any advice on how I could apply for grants for her?   I found a VA Arts grant that helps to pay for students in training.  She wouldnt be going to an arts school specifically but maybe I can still apply?   </body>
