      <body>Would you be ok if I made a reservation for 7? I'll have to take care of ####### before leaving and it will take a little time to walk there. Btw - it is cash only too.</body>

      <body>Fine with me! Thanks for the cash only tip, I'll have to remember to hit the atm.</body>

      <body>Cool! I doubt we'll need a reservation but I will call tomorrow to be safe. (They are closed today.) I also have a red wine (Shiraz) that I was going to bring. Is this ok or would you prefer white?</body>
