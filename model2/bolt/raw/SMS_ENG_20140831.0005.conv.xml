      <body>First off I want to apologize again.  If I need to spray the whole house I will.   Part of the issue would be getting everyone to bag &amp; wash everything.  But if it needs to get done it needs to get done.  

This is one of the many reasons I wish Beth was handling this job.   Did you get a chance to call her?  </body>

      <body>No one had ever had an issue with bed bugs in your room before you moved in.  But no one was living in your room when this problem first occurred.   The girl who had been living there had already moved in with her boyfriend a couple months before.  Then Kaushal basically used it as storage while waiting for Oliver to move.   </body>

      <body>Only David &amp; Phillip had an issue &amp; I thought the problem was addressed &amp; done with.  We only sprayed your room as a precaution.  No one told me anything about not putting stuff against the walls or using the closet.   </body>

      <body>And this is in no way blaming you - but if I had known about your getting bites right when you moved in I think we could have jumped on this issue earlier before it got out of control.  </body>

      <body>It is possible that a few of the other rooms have bedbugs but it is unlikely.  I have sent out several texts to everyone in the house in the last month or so. </body>

      <body>On August 14th I sent this text to everyone in the house --  "Have you noticed any bed bugs or any bug bites? Ingrid thinks she may have them.  I'm waiting on a call back from the exterminator."   I sent a couple follow up texts also.  </body>

      <body>I suspect if Beth was around she would have made you wash / bag everything before she treated the first time &amp; all the bed bugs would have been dead 2 weeks ago.  

I have to go to work now but I'll call Beth tomorrow morning.  </body>
