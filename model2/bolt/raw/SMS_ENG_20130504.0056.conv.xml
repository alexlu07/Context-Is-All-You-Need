      <body>Thank you for asking. You are very kind. Alhamdulillah the doctor explained the results and believes (at least for now) that there is no worry at all about anything malignant or not malignant. It was very reassuring... I am hoping to work on my Penn paper this weekend and won't be going to May Day. I wish you a good time today and I guess you will be contacting me at some point regarding our coming meetings. </body>
