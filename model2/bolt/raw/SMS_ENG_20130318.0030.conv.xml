      <body>Caesar, unfortunately not. This week is different as I show I co curated is opening on Wednesday.  You are more than invited to join if interested. It's about twelve interactive pieces set up at massart (621 huntington ave 11th floor) on the 20th at 6 pm!  It would be a pleasure to see you.  So this week is a little hectic, but I'm free Friday! </body>
