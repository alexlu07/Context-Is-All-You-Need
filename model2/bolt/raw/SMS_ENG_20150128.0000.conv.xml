      <body>The evening will start with a casual happy hour in the City Council Caucus Room at City Hall, where finalists can set up a "science fair" type presentation.  Attendees will walk around the room, and they can stop and chat with you.  You can have materials, handouts, photos, etc. to give to/show the attendees.  This is a laid back, informal opportunity to talk about your idea/venture.Around 7:15pm, everyone will move into the Council Chambers, and the pitches will begin.  Each finalist (we expect there to be five in total) will have 3 minutes maximum to pitch their idea.  Powerpoints are allowed, but not mandatory.  If you are using a Powerpoint, you must send it to Rachel no later than 10pm on Tuesday, January 27th.After each pitch, an esteemed panelist of judges - Ryan Stewart, Executive Director of the Office of School Improvement and Innovation at the School District; Bill Green, Chair of the School Reform Commission; Stacy Holland, Executive Director of the Lenfest Foundation; and Chris Angelini, High School English Teacher - will ask you questions/offer critiques for about 5 minutesAfter all five pitches/Q&amp;A with judges, the audience will then vote for a winner, and the winner will get $5,000</body>
