      <body>If you're freaking out so much then maybe you shouldn't? I feel like if you wanted to do it, there wouldn't be any hesitation. If your only reason to not do it is because your afraid of losing your summer...not a good reason. If it's money, you can't put a price on education. Ergo, there's no reason to not go for it, unless you really don't want to.</body>
