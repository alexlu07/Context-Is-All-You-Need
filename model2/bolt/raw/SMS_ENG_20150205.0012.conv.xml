      <body>Artificial amateurs aren't all amazing, analytically I assault, animate things.

Broken barriers bounded by the bomb beat. Buildings are broken, basically I'm bombarding.

Casually create catastrophes, casualties. Canceling cats got their canopies collapsing.

Detonate a dime of dank daily doing dough. Demonstrations don dada on the down low.

Guess what I'm trying to learn :D</body>
