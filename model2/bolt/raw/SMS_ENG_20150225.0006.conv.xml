      <body>that when that guy kissed me last weekend. it was actually really bad. Like i had left the party to go home and he chased after me. Like RAN after me and was like let me walk you home and I was like no. Any respectful non-drunk person would have been like, ok let me get you a cab! BUT NO its ok bc your super drunk and I’m super drunk for me to disregard what you say and follow you, at full pace, down the street. This world is completely sexist. </body>

      <body>Ok. We were all at a party. and we were kinda cuddling on the couch - that part is hazy - not just me and this kid, but like a group of four us piled drunkenly onto the couch. And kyle was like touching the small of my back... you know like very flirty. like something that i would have never let happen if i wasn’t drunk. bc i was so loaded i could just pretend it wasn’t happening. And then i was like it’s time to go. I got up and all of us started leaving. I got out of the building first, and said goodbye. and then I’m half way down the block and kyle yelled. wait. I’m coming with you. </body>
