      <body>If its during the day, transfer at 30th st to the market-Frankford line headed west and get off at 46th st. It's a five minute walk to my house. You could also from 30th st. get on the 34 trolley which will take you down Baltimore ave, pull to get off at 45th st for my house or 49th st for HM</body>
