      <body>It's not a biggie I kinda have a good idea.   I talked to Richie yesterday. He was supposed to spy on Gabe and come up with gifts for me but he's slacking.  Rrrrr!  Ideas are so hard!  I hate giving gift cards tho.  They seem impersonal.   ...but if it's my only option, I'll do it as a last resort.</body>
