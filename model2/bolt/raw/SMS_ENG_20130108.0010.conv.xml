      <body>Good meeting with Gina! She says she likes our democratic secret vote, and she's happy to be a tiebreaker but she trusts our judgment. She also says the whole blackboard system is going away, so minors on the email list will have to be by whoever expresses interest. And finally, we should have AT LEAST one event per month - the more the better!</body>

      <body>Ok sounds good! We should find a way to contact minors to see if they want to be added to the listserve</body>

    <message id="m0010" participant="133056" time="2013-01-09 00:06:11 UTC">
      <body>That was the one problem: she says there's some policy about handing out email addresses to us. But she says when she meets with minors (for advisement, in class, etc.), she plans to ask all of them if they want to be added. We'll add them if they want it. So she likes the idea, and it's out of our hands now =P</body>

      <body>She loved it! She actually likes all the freshman. Oh also - Gina suggested that those who don't get chosen for eBoard, can be part of "committees". If we have long term projects (ie. Welcome Week), we can call on the committee members to kind of organize the event and check in with us</body>
