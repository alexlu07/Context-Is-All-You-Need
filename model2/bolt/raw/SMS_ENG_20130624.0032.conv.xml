      <body>I'm getting nervous about my poster for tomorrow. I don't think it's very good/innovative. I was wondering if you would like to meet a little earlier, I think there will be a lot to go over. Like maybe 4? That way we can be leisurely?</body>

      <body>Sure. Don't be nervous. If you already knew how to do this then we wouldn't be doing the study. :)</body>
