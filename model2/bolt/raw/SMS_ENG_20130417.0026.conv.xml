      <body>Ok, I was thinking about your question about the 50's background, and was thinking maybe something reminiscent of the old tv shows, like the Ed Sullivan show.  </body>

      <body>So I'm thinking open with modern band until first chorus. Then intersperse diff time periods 2nd verse until monk dance. Then end on modern band where you start, "I'll be back tomorrow"</body>

      <body>I just e-mailed you a few links of Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Chuck Berry.  Maybe there's something that can resemble the backgrounds from those old TV performances?  </body>

      <body>The one thing I was thinking about the castle background is that while it looks very good visually, it makes me think medieval, not renaissance.  I had a few ideas.  </body>

    <message id="m0023" participant="132555" time="2013-04-17 14:50:16 UTC">
      <body>Perhaps a renaissance painting such as Raphael's  school of Athens, or botticelli's primavera could make a good background. Or, maybe the leaning tower of Pisa? </body>

    <message id="m0024" participant="130747" time="2013-04-17 14:50:53 UTC">
      <body>OK tower of Pisa might work nicely</body>

    <message id="m0025" participant="130747" time="2013-04-17 14:51:16 UTC">
      <body>I dun think a painting would look as good</body>

    <message id="m0026" participant="132555" time="2013-04-17 15:03:22 UTC">
      <body>One other thing: between the monk dance and the "I'll be back tomorrow" line there is a third chorus.  There should probably be more interspersing of different time periods in that section (from 2:30-2:55) as well.  </body>

      <body>By the way, if you don't find anything that you like, I think the background you chose for the 50's, with the car, was pretty good. </body>
