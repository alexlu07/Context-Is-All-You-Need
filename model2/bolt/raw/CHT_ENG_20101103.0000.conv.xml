      <body>Howdy ELF.  Can you explain the advantage to buying a xbox 360 vs. a ps3?</body>

      <body>Depends on what you're looking for. Most of the franchises are no longer console-specific, but some are, so you have to look at which games you want to play.</body>

      <body>Unfortunately, consoles seem to retain their value far longer than almost anything else these days, so it's unlikely you'd find any of them for much lower than sticker price</body>

      <body>see, normally I just play on my PC, but my laptop sucks and my desktop died.  I had a wii but sold it.  One of the advantages to not being a 'gamer' anymore is that I will be completely satisfied w/ a ps2. By the time the next new console is released, Ill be able to pick up a ps3 for a nickel</body>
