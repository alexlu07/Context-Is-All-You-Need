      <body>Want to collaborate on a video piece for IcA open call? (Via internet of course.) I want to make something related to my friend's job. She is a painter but is now forced to run those painting nights for yuppies on dates. It seems like prime satire material and also art critical material and also related to naive painting/child painting, which I think you'd be interested in </body>
