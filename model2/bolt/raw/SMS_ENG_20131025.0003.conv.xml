      <body>Jane and I are planning out a lesson schedule for winter on Friday afternoons like today, What do you think about me factoring in a lesson on lucky even though we will be on a "break" from the program until spring? I think that would be a nice way for me to keep up with him and keep him jumping a little over the winter. Let me know :) </body>
