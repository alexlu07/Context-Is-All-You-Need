      <body>Brynn. Scout ran away from Kelly at the office. They're looking for him, the police and all the vets and shelters have been notified. Dad and I came back to look for him. I found tracks that led back to the shed and then into somebody's back yard. I followed them as far as I could, He made a bunch of circles in one yard and then I think he slipped through the fence and back into the subdivision. From there I can't tell where he went... Maybe towards Wendy's? We have to get going now... I'll let you know if we hear anything. :( </body>
