      <body>Im going to buy these ones tomorrow: TGT's new CD, her perfume ($9), COD ps3 game ($40), GTA5 ps3 game ($40), and sonic game ($15)....

She also wanted a black soft leather handbag with a lot of pockets. That's going to be about $20-50 depending on which bag.  I'm waiting to see what it is during the sale tom.
