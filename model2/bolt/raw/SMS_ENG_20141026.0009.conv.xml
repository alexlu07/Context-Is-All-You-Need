      <body>Cool. It's $80 a ticket - I know it's a lot. Ryan Adams always sells out so they jack the prices. I bought the tickets fully prepared to cover the cost myself though, so I'm fine with whatever you're comfortable paying! Seriously. Butch is only opening, so 25% of ticket cost? :) </body>
