      <body>Sounds great! I've never been to a season opener but I'm told if we show our tix we also get access to the Cadillac Grille. Not sure what this is but I guess we can check it out if we want. If into or if it is a bust my plan is to get a sausage and pepper sandwich. I can almost taste this already! </body>

      <body>According to website Cadillac Grille opens two hours b4 game but looks a little fancy to me. We could check it out for a drink before the game but I still see a sausage and pepper sandwich in my future.  </body>
