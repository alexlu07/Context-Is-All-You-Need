      <body>My blood work looks normal. She put me on a generic Zoloft and klonopin if I need for anxiety.  Seems that the high BP is stress related. I'm going to see a movement disorder specialist on April 14. And my primary care dr again in a month. Hopefully the new meds will bring my stress levels down and that will help with the ringing in my ears.</body>
