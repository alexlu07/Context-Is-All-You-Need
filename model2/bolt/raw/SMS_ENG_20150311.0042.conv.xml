      <body>Hi kazuki and Jenna, to move on the the next step on location: the apartment I found owner says we can come in any day as long as they got enough time to sleep. And I need to know which day are we using the car so I can hook it ahead of time. Have u you guys figured out Todman booking schedule yet? Just trying to clean things up before I leave for spring break :) </body>
