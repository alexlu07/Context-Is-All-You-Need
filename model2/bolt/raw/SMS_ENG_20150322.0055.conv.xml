      <body>Conductor story: he saw me, turned to Tanzin, and said "ever notice his hair is never messed up? It's never out of place." I feel like he was trying to play me in front of her. 

Tanzin responded by looking at me and going "it's perfect. Your hairs always perfect."

It came to mind when we were walking and I was telling you that she liked my hair. That's why I started talking about the conductor.. to tell you this lol</body>
