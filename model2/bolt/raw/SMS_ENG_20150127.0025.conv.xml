      <body>He did the typical walk by and say hey on the way to the bathroom. I was helping other people when he came back but he waited for like at least 5 minutes while I was dealing w them and he was just like so hey I was like hi he's like I haven't seen you the past few days I was like I know I haven't been here he was like soooo yeah I'm like what? He's like nothing I was like alright he's like so you said you wanted to talk I just kinda was like yeah... He was like "if you ever wanna talk let me know" in like a weird way so I was like what do you mean and he just kinda looked at me then walked away. Wtf does that mean. Should I text him? Be like "sorry didn't expect that but yes if you're ever free lets talk"</body>
