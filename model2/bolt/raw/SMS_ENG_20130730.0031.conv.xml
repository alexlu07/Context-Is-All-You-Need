      <body>I only have one opinion on this separation and it's that I feel it's super necessary for both of you to move in a positive direction and see the positive and maintain a safe and happy environment for US because otherwise it just weighs me and the boys down and we can't think of anything but how unhappy you are. And then we are worried about you which is called "inappropriate parenting" and is very toxic for children. Maybe that is very selfish that I'm asking you to move forward and be positive for me but it is your responsibility as parents. This is what my therapist says and I really really trust her she's very smart</body>
