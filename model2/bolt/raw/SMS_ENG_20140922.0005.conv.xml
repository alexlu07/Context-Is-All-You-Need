      <body>Hey gabi! This is Jennie. I wanted to let you know that Zach is out surgery. It went really well - super easy. We met with surgeon but haven't seen Zach yet. Zach is definitely going to need you guys in the coming weeks. This may be just the beginning. Overall, doctor was extremely positive. We don't know all details - those will come is 5-10 days after biopsy is done. I'll let you know when he is movin around - maybe by the end of the week you could stop by? I'm sure it will be helpful for ppl to keep him company while we wait for more details.</body>
