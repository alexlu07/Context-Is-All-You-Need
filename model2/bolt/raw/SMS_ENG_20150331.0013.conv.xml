      <body>Thank you so much for coming over!  After you left I found the glass of water I poured you on the counter- I felt like such an asshole!  Also- I was really sad we had to cut down the tree- but it was dangerous it had started to loose a lot of branches-  don't know why I felt I wanted to tell you that - I just did.  We're planting a lot of new trees to help make up for it.  </body>
