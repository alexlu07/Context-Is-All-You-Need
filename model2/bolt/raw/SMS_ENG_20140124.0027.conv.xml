      <body>One thing I wanted to say for you to tell Steven. When I was an undergrad, I went to a session that talked about how to prepare for grad school. It was something started by the linguistics club, and a few Ling professors who were in charge of admissions into the masters/phd spoke there. They said for applications and interviews, when professor say "why X" like "why Linguistics", they don't want to hear things like "I loved it ever since I was a kid/I feel like it's my calling"</body>

    <message id="m0032" time="2014-01-25 02:06:47 UTC" participant="152116">
      <body>Yeah I think they look for answers like what specifically you like about the field and how you plan on using it to make a difference. I guess that's the difference between undergrad and grad. In grad school you have more of a direction and the school wants to see that you know what direction you're going</body>
