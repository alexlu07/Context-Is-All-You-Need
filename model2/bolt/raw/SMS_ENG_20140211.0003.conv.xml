      <body>I'm meeting with Michael tomorrow about work.  I may call you in the morning about that job you got if you need help. I'm ordering a respirator and filters tonight. It'll be around $30 for a set of filters and a 3m mask that accepts all kinds of readily available filters. Do you want me to order you one?</body>
