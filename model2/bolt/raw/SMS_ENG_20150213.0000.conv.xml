      <body>I don't know. It doesn't have to be language data related, just language or linguistics related. I'm thinking about how you can make the vocal tract from household items. Like we can have tubes for them. If you set them up in certain ways, blowing into it can make an AH or EE or OO sound.</body>

      <body>We do machine translation stuff, so I'm wondering how I can adapt that</body>

      <body>Well if you have older kids you can just really simplify the concept of machine translation with examples. It doesn't necessarily have to be hands on.</body>

      <body>I like the tubes. Even if you have posters with all the different places you can put your tongue to produce different sounds would be good. You can teach some kids how to roll their r' s.</body>
