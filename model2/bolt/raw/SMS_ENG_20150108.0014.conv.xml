      <body>I got Adam to help next weekend with tiling and grouting the shower. So you and I will probably tile the floor and grout it next week and he and I will do the shower Saturday and grout it sunday. Then we'll install toilet and sink the following Wednesday and it'll all be done. So hopefully we're are 2 weeks from the finish line right now. I guess I should see if dan can come next Thursday to make sure the boiler and your radiators are in good shape</body>
