      <body>SO. My professor picked you! Mr. Spielpalast! He thinks it sounds super interesting and he thinks Burlington is an especially unique market. Would you have any time this week for a little bit longer of a phone chat? We can plan something out? </body>

      <body>Also I'll be coming to burly march 14th and staying for a couple days. Conveniently with the girl who's been assigned to work with me too. So if phone calls are too hard to arrange we can all just meet in person! </body>
