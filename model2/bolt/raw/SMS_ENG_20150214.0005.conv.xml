      <body>“Cris S:
So I think Jeff stood me up
This has never happened to me before
Yeah he got here and dumped me
Said the chemistry wasn't there
Sofie Elana Hodara:
I’m so sorry cris. that is such a surprise!
You must have felt blind sighted
Cris S:
Yeah
I'm completely shocked. 
I thought he really liked me but he said there was just something missing
I wish he wouldn't have told me he liked me and saw potential for something right before sleeping with me.
Sofie Elana Hodara:
i know that feels really bad but if there is any consolation i really believe he meant it
Cris S:
Maybe. But we don't talk for a week then he tells me he only sees me as a friend?
I mean I sleep with someone a few times before chalking it up to lack of chemistry
40 minutes late doesn't even apologizes, just says there's no chemistry then leaves
I'm so disappointed in him. We could've talked the next day or something 
He really broke my heart
Damn man I want to send him a final letter or something. But it'll do no good. I feel like he was so nervous but so into me, that nervousness seeped into our sex, but it's too late now. Whatever, I can't believe he acted like this. 
Right before this he kissed me deeply and said he was leaving for a week but to not assume he was disappearing. I tried trusting him but that's exactly what happened.
I totally regret not asking him if there was anyone else”
