      <body>Yo Gabi! If you're around this weekend why don't we get together and create a little music. Either at my home during the day or at the rock sun clock at oak ledge before sunset with some drums and a horn. Also I talked to Jess and she's cool with hooking up the 6 th grade jazz band for you. I'm also going to try and get you as a jazz band assistant though I can't promise that quite yet. Either way lets hook up soon with some instruments. Be well!</body>
