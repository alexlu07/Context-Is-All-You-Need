 April is the cruellest month, breeding	 
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing	 
Memory and desire, stirring	 
Dull roots with spring rain.	 
Winter kept us warm, covering	         
Earth in forgetful snow, feeding	 
A little life with dried tubers.	 
Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee	 
With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,	 
And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,	  
And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.	 
Bin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch.	 
And when we were children, staying at the archduke’s,	 
My cousin’s, he took me out on a sled,	 
And I was frightened. He said, Marie,	  
Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.	 
In the mountains, there you feel free.
