      <body>Hey Sam. I meant to text you earlier but I've had work the past two days. It's been so hard to coordinate a time for everyone to meet Jeff so if Friday works for everyone, don't cancel because of me. If you go out for dinner, I can meet up with you afterwards or possibly meet in the middle of dinner. It's totally fine. Everyone wants to meet him and I don't want to delay it any longer.
