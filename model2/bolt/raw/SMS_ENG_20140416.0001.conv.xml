      <body>Hey Brett, sorry I didn't get to see you and Sarah, I was staying with people and was kind of at the mercy of their schedule cuz I had no wheels. However, I think I will be back in June to visit my girlfriends grandfather in Laguna beach in June. You Sarah and the baby should come down and spend a day on the beach with us if I end up doing that. Hope you are able to get a little sleep and your little one is happy and healthy. </body>
