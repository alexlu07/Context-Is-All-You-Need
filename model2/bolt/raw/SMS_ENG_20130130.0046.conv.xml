      <body>I took her sis to the airport yesterday and she came along. Did some crying but seemed well otherwise. She went back to work today. And is going to see my therapist I think today or soon. So all positive things (although I was surprised she's back at work so soon and a little worried. However her boss emailed me unprovoked to say they were taking care of her, which was nice.)</body>
