      <body>So the website has photos but the photos are of the kitchen mainly, and show off elegant aspects of the room but do not show the walls and how they would relate to each other in terms of hanging paintings. I would like to take photos that would highlight the space for the artist. May I come take some. I have a professional camera. </body>

      <body>I will send you photos of the paintings soon. The person I want to show is teaching painting in France while her class traces the footsteps of Corot. Her current work is ideal for your space. Landscapes/seascapes. I'm already close to her primary gallerist so the process will be streamlined too, which is a plus. </body>
