      <body>Ohhh what kind of grown up breakfast? It was good, the food was tasty. It's becoming a pattern that I get home recently at night? Get changed, and accidentally fall asleep without doing my nightly routine (which is not good). I then wake up earlier than expecting and try to get myself to fall back asleep. I woke up around 7 something this morning and successfully went back to sleep. I woke up at 8 something yesterday and didn't and that why I got tired pretty early last night.</body>

      <body>So we went to eat first. I ate way too much and pretty much gorged. By the time we got to Bambu, I was so full and had to slowly sip my #10 (btw, my friends really like my drink)! I was feeling full and lethargic for hours. Even walking around Center City didn't help make it go away. Even by the time we went to dinner, I was the only one to not get anything. I was just sipping water because I was still full!</body>
