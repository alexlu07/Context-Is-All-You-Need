      <body>Hi everyone! I've spoken to my friend Samantha stJaques who is married to Pierre stJaques an upper level dressage rider/ trainer. He is willing to come here or you are welcome to go to him for lessons up in orefield area ( above Allentown) if he comes to you lesson costs $125 if you go to him it's $100. Let me know if you would be interested. I was hoping we could do it here and have a few in a row for him ( I am not making money from this! Just thought it would be fun for us all to be together ) :) he can do any evening 5:30pm on or on a Sunday. Let me know!! :) </body>
