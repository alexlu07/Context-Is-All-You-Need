      <body>i think its natural for her to have a lot of things on her mind right now. This is probabaly her first holiday season without her ex around in a lonnngg time which is probably hard for her, let a lone the kids. Plus she obviously doesnt know how to feel about your guys' 'relationship' or how to define it right now and everything is muddled. Not to mention the fact that she is probably trying to gain some real closure with the ex if the final divorce decree is upcoming.</body>

      <body>haha well again, i think that its poor timing and that played a large factor in her response. More of an attachment on your side at this particular time may have pushed her away and made her a little bit wary. Or amde her realize that she needs time to really figure stuff out.</body>

      <body>yeaa too late to tell her that you dont care about the divorce thing--that wouldnt change her need/decision to take some time to sort things out. And considering that you guys are just 'friends' right now, you def shouldnt be getting her anything else more than flowers. I think the flowers are ok though--its a nice gesture.</body>
