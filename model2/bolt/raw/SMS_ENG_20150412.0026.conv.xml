      <body>Ok so I've already talked to auntie Raine and uncle joe is out in the woods but Chloe messed up her foot and I think it might be broken or like a stress fracture and she's in a lot of pain and I've given her tylenol and we're icing it right now and it's elevated and student health is closed and everything closed   At 5 and so I don't know what else to do for her without going to the ER... Any suggestions? </body>
