      <body>Nicole, its Sofie. I was listening to Cerens crit and heard you mention Sophie calle!  I just wanted to say I met her at the Gardner this year.  It was so cool she was doing interviews about the missing work. It was so awesome!!!! I thought you might appreciate it. Literally, after i saw her - which was a total surprise -I got back to the studio and no one knew who she was :(</body>
