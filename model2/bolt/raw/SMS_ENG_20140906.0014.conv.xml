      <body>I went down today he seems to be doing better but they have to wait a few days to see if he goes to hospice or into a nursing home. My step grandma ran him over with a tiny tractor which is what sent him in. I know that shouldn't be funny but my dad keeps making jokes about it.</body>

      <body>Woah that's a crazy story! There's definitely humor there, dark, but that's the best kind. Glad he's doing better. And glad it wasn't attempted murder. Hope it's been nice to see your family, despite the circumstances.</body>

      <body>Yeah when my dad was describing the tractor incident I could just picture it. Family is stressed. A lot of financial talk but nice to be together for a little while.</body>
