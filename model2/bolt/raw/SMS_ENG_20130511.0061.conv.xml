      <body>Don't listen to mom... if you want to move in with us you will have your own key and can come home whatever time you want bec we won't wait up like she does, and unlike dad all our locks are the same so we can lock up and when you get home just re-lock everything... and you can have company over any night as long as you guys aren't loud and partying on the nights we have to get up for work</body>
