      <body>Hey Linds! I have a random question, how was urban and bye about letting you out of your lease early? I may found someone but didn't know how urban and bye would handle it. Did Nellie just sign a new lease? Do you know if she had to put down first, last and security?</body>

      <body>It's super easy. They have a single page form that you both sign and they get a new lease. Nellie wrote me a check for last months and security. They didn't even do a walk through to check for damages.</body>
