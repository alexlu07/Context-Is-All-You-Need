      <body>Mark needs the car by 11:40 tomorrow morning. Did you want to meet a little earlier than 10? Does your dog(s) go for short walks or long walks? Do you have to do something afterwards anyway? I hate sharing the car like this!!! It's a new thing for me and it looks like it's going to be like this for a while...</body>
