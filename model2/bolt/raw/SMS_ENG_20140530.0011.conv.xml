      <body>So I have an idea. For Christmas maybe we can get a clutter organizer to go to mom's house a couple weeks ahead of time and help her get organized and clean up and that could be her Christmas present. That way she won't feel so embarrassed when we come up.  I can get quotes.  They'll probably need to buy storage organizers and stuff.  Cant imagine it would be more than $400 or so.  Whatcha think. </body>

      <body>If we try to do it with her, she'll get upset and not want to do it. She honestly needs to throw so many clothes away</body>
