      <body>Sorry yester I couldn't really come up stuff. Its hard cuz I hate asking for stuff. If it's too late that's totally fine, I prefer it But a couple lil things: leather belt (the kind that snap off to change buckles), 4lb sledge, 1 of those square flat breakfast frying pan things, inexpensive hydrologic car jack, 8 track player, a roasting pan big enough for a turkey, a Dremel, table clamps, the thinnest/cheapest/most thermal gloves made from that wet suit material ....as long as its cheap, small folding (work type) hand cart... Phew!  THAT WAS TOUGH!  Thats a bunch of stuff I can't bring myself to get for myself.  ...I'd prefer they didn't get me anything tho but.... I'd really like anything old or that theyd like for me to hang on my wall also. CHEAP!</body>
