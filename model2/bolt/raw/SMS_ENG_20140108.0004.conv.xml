      <body>Another night another question!  I'm craving the sweet and sour "chicken" from sunflower....any idea how I could make it at home?  It's not tofu right?</body>

      <body>Well that one is a little tougher! Not tofu, tofu's softer, probably some kind of sunflower magic tvp. You could get plain fake chikn at the grocery store (I like quorn or maybe smartlife strips for this) and use it in any general tso's recipe. Or get Jason to go to Vienna and get you the real deal! </body>
