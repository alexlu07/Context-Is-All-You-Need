      <body>Hey Kurt, I hate to do this so last minute but I need to cancel for today, my friend is getting here at 11am and I'm afraid I won't be back in time. I can do it tomorrow as my guest is leaving late tonight. I could still do it today if it is pretty close but it seemed like it was more than 45 minutes away </body>
