      <body>Hiii :)) Nicole is not gonna study abroad in fall..and her loans only pay for dorms so she's staying in the dorm. I'm going to stay for two months here in summer :) if you guys aren't staying I'll try one month in the dorm then another month crushing in someone else's place and be gone before that person gets annoyed and tired of me hahah. Yup that's the plan. But I can totally find someone else who's going to need an apartment in the spring and swap you out if you two are still up for that plan :) or I'll still be in dorm in spring eheh</body>
