      <body>Sofie!  I'm so sorry I didn't text you yesterday, happy birthday sweetheart!!  I knew it was your birthday, I'm such an idiot, I went out to dinner and forgot my phone and was so sleepy when I got home, I'm such a spacey jerk.  I love you so much beautiful, I hope you had a wonderful birthday, can you talk soon?</body>
