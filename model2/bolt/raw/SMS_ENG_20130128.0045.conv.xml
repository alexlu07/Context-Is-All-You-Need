      <body>Ok, sure - that is one of the things I wanted to ask you about, where do I send the check? I'm catching up &amp; will email any other questions too. I rode Louie a bunch before last week - he's been great. The past week has been arctic &amp; I was going to ride today but it's snowing! The rest of the week looks better though. </body>

      <body>Would it work if we both have Tanya $500 each month. And then I can let you know when he gets his feet done and I get a bill?</body>
