      <body>He said he's staying home. But it's because I literally called him about 3 times and sent him countless of texts. He has never slept through that much and he didn't work last night so there's no reason why he should have slept through his "3 alarms" and everything. 

And he wouldn't hear an argument. He just said he had to get his assignments done. My guess is that there was some assignment he forgot about and he purposely didn't come. </body>

      <body>Besides, if you know that you're supposed to go somewhere, you generally don't oversleep. </body>
