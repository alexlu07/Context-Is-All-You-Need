      <body>So it looks like Joe really wants to talk because he said please call me tonight. The disability makes me a semi- hostage. At first I read it and got nervous. It seemed negative. But he said lol at the end. So I guess he doesn't get out much to talk to people.</body>

      <body>If he has something interesting to say, something that makes both you and him a specific ethnicity, then he wants to share it with you because it effects you. I don't think he'll understand that I care as much as I do, so I say you should call and at least introduce me. Trust me, I want to be the one who talks to him. I know I'm better at it and am now even more excited.</body>
