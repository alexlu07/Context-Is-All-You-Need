      <body>Hi love! Hope you had a lovely thanksgiving! So for sunday, we looked at a map and realized we're actually kind of far...but we'll be coming down 476 on our way back, so maybe we could meet up somewhere along there? Would that work for you? </body>

      <body>Okay great! And actually, I don't know what your plans are like, but would it make sense for us to do dinner tomorrow night instead? We're thinking of maybe heading back tomorrow night instead</body>

      <body>There's a great restaurant at a store called Terrain. It's about an hour from Lancaster. I think it will be about 20 minutes out of your way. Take a look at google maps and let me know it that works for you.</body>
