      <body>Soraya. I dont have much to say to that, because i know anything that i say will not be what you want to hear, because ill bet theres nothing you want to hear right now. But youre lying to yourself. In the mind of everyone else, youre next to perfect, even if you dont feel like it at the moment. 

Like absolutely perfect.

Also, lets get froyo. Right now.</body>

      <body>I would've liked to get froyo with you and I'm sad that I cannot. But see you being nice just makes me feel worse about making you go to prom with me because I look like a fat, Indian platypus wearing a dirty Brillo pad on its head and I speak like an un-funny, depressed Kathy griffin. And really all of Kathy griffins appeal is her red hair  </body>

      <body>You know that's all a bunch of bullpuckey. Sure, I asked Laura before I asked you, but as things played out the last few weeks, I honestly and truly can think of no one that I would want to be going with on Friday more than you, bar none. For fear of sounding creepy AF, i wont comment on your stunning body, but I can safely say that your hair is probably in my top 5 best in the school. That list aint easy to get on. 

But truly, you are being too hard on yourself. Youre awesome, and dont forget that. As Dory sorta said, "just keep" smilin' bud</body>
