      <body>So this has been under the radar so dont mention it to your parents but My dad has to have a bypass... I'm just overwhelmed. Someone just asked me about my resolutions for 2012 and I couldn't even think about the future. I know this is intense for a text I just can't even get a word out if I tried.</body>
