      <body>Week, group projects with the little ones... I'm good, dropped stuff off at the student life gallery for the 1st show.  Too many people opted in for the 2nd, so I offered to show in 1st.  I'm kind of psyched though, there is not much stuff, so they wanted all 3 of my pieces.  
So, I went to Trader Joe's yesterday to pick up cranberry juice... It was so mobbed that I spent $130, and somehow managed to leave without cranberry juice... Story if my life, short term memory loss Cait! </body>
