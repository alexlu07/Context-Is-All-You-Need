      <body>Good morning Julia! :-) Sorry for the late notice but I was waiting to see if I would be okay, I'm not going to be able to have a lesson on lucky today my back is still not right. So I just wanted to let you know in case you want to ride otherwise if you want I can lunge him or something so that if you made plans to not come to the barn today you won't have to worry about him not getting exercise, let me know, thanks!p</body>
