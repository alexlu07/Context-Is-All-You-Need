      <body>Daniel!!!! Hey sorry. This is the first moment I've had to think about school since I saw you last.  Anyway I wanted to talk to you in person about independent study but I don't know when I'll see you. I feel bad cause gunta said she would not be able to pay you but that  you were welcome to be involved. I really wish you and I could work together though and I was thinking I could bring you dinner and in exchange we could discuss things periodically.     </body>
