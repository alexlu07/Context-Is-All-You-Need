      <body>What in the world...I was talking to mommy about the classes I have to take and everything. Woman be crazy, she doesn't understand why I have to take summer classes. She then proceeded to ask what happened to all the other classes I took at villanova. Haha. I said it was that I wasn't a science major so all of those classes didn't count. 
She said "you have to do this and then another 3.5 years at jefferson?" I said "yeah, or I could not go to nursing school at all." That shut her up real fast. </body>
