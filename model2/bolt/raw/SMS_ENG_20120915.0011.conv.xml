      <body>Hi Sofie - are you planning to come to Scituate tomorrow? If so, I've got 2 people who would like to get a ride, assuming you've got room. 

One of them is Alex, 2nd year DMI who taught the Processing workshop on Saturday. The other is Pol, my friend from Barcelona who's an interactive designer and is getting his PhD at the Media Lab at MIT. 

Let me know.
Thanks.</body>
