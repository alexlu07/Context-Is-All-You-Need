      <body>We are OK. I am starting to have the euphoria of living without the abuse. It is so sweet. Phew. The boys are very happy. Kofi's character has changed overnight. He is not an introvert anymore. He is coming out of the shell and has a completely different energy about him. Shenandoah had told me a few weeks ago that he will be delighted if we separate because his dad is so negative. Soraya was extremely angry for a few days. But she has called down. She is a drama queen anyhow....I am still a little tired from the whole episode and I feel that I need some time to recuperate. To rest. But there is so much do...I am not complaining. I am grateful that so far it has been a peaceful separation. I am worried a little about the future and mark's attitude in the coming year. I mean who knows he is so unpredictable. Hope to see you soon.</body>
