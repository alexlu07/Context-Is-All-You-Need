      <body>Hmmm so it looks like it might not even be worth you getting tested bc they don't do anything to treat men or women for hpv anyway- they just monitor women in case it causes cancer later on if your body doesn't get rid of it on it's own ￼You could get tested anyway, to make sure it isn't something else I suppose? But since my Pap smear came back positive, meaning I likely have hpv, that is prob what it is (if anything at all) and maybe your body didn't deal w it bc of your lowered immune system due to your gum infection. Anyway, your call. I don't need you to get tested as I've been tested for everything and if you had any other std I would have acquired it already. I don't care if you gave me hpv, it's no big deal, and if I gave it to you I'm sorry. I tested neg for it at my last pap smear 6 months ago but who knows. </body>
