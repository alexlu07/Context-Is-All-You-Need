      <body>So I'm a moron. I forgot that I can't swim this week. I can still go to the walk-through though, and walk home with you after if you like? Or I can wait while you swim! Just can't seem this week.</body>

      <body>Yep. That sounds good. Got a free lunch from the gym today. Well not exactly free if u consider I paid $135 for another 3 months, but still better than no lunch.</body>
