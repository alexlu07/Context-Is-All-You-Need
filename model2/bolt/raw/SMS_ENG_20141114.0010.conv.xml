You can just type it up. It's hard to do it on the computer when I'm at work but nobody bothers me when I'm concentrating with papers in my hand haha</body>

      <body>OH and fox 29 had a vet on and she said that one of the main reasons why dogs come to the vet is because of allergies. The thing about these allergies...in dogs, it apparently happens on their skin as opposed to runny noses and itchy eyes. So they're extremely itchy! Has to be what's wrong with the tipsy dog. She must have allergies. </body>
