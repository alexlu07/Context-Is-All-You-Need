      <body>Hi Jane, did you hear from Gerry? Dollar's shoe is off. I'm guessing I should soak and wrap before he goes out?</body>

      <body>I talked to him, he says soak and poultice and he'll put the shoe back on in 4 or 5 days. He suggested turning him out in the paddock, what do you think? Also, should he still get bute?</body>

      <body>Maybe bute another day or two,and turned out wherever he will not pace or walk extra! Probably better to follow normal routine?</body>

      <body>Yeah, even though the paddock is smaller I think he might worry and walk more! I am going to tape that foot up good and just put him out in the big field, I think - it's just him &amp; Bach and he is not wild at all. I'll do bute for the next couple days too. Thanks!</body>
