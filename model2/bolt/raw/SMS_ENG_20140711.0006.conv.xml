      <body>Sorry I've been so MIA. I have instructor meetings on Tuesday and office hours on Wed and Thurs for the class I'm teaching this month! But hope to see you soon. Also ####### (that game I play) is coming out for iPhone probably within the next week. If you are interested I'll give you a run through. But you have to join the ################### team :) </body>
