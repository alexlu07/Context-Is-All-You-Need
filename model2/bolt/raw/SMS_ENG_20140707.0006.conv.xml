      <body>OH! Would I be OK with sneakers for a quick lesson? I don't have riding boots anymore. I think I'm going to have to borrow cowboy boots at the ranch. </body>

      <body>Do you have anything boot like with a small heel - doc martens, hiking boots, oxfords even? The heel keeps your foot from sliding through the stirrup. If not, sneaks will work! </body>

      <body>I don't :/ All my boss have at least two inch heels. I MIGHT have low oxfords but they aren't actually boots (they're below the ankle) </body>
