      <body>Wow I wonder who did the stats on that? Is that in the brochure?  If only I could have gone to an elite school like that! And that still means that 60% have potential...</body>

      <body>She was there for two days hanging out with her friends and confirms that there is no potential. The worse part is that the student body is extremely homogenous: they are all "interesting" Suburbanites. Plus the bubble factor and no city... </body>

      <body>That's us too . And that is lilys greatest fear .... On the other hand they are there to be challenged academically and maybe  being around familiar kids helps give them some comfort. I have no idea anymore...maybe you and mark could set up a home school for college people</body>

      <body>I know that she will thrive in Montreal if she were to go there. I am sad that she had to go for Vassar. Some of the reasons she declined McGill were the need to be very self reliant, huge classes, uncertainty about internship possibilities, distance from home, and perhaps to please mark...I am encouraging her to keep transfer in mind. </body>

      <body>She is hoping to visit NYC a lot. She has a very good friend who is going to Barnard... Also junior year abroad, and internships in NYC in the summers... Still I feel miserable that she didn't choose McGill. I don't like the mentality of these small colleges...</body>
