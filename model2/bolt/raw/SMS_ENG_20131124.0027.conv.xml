      <body>Also, i just realized I did something wrong for one of Angelo's French sentences. Can you fix it and let him know. In the file "aimer" it says "Joey aime jouer les jeux" but it should say "Joey aime jouer aux jeux". ("aux" is "à" + "les"; in other words, you need the preposition "à" before "les" and together they become "aux")</body>
