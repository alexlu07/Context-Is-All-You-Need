      <body>yeah.. i'm at marina's, but i've been sick most of the week, characteristically.  i'm starting to feel better,though, which is good, because portland requires strength, i think.  the folks left me to go to bellingham today, which makes for a strange last day in seattle.  i've been pawing through craigslist, but i think i'm going to take a break, make some food, and read a book about flowers for a while.</body>
