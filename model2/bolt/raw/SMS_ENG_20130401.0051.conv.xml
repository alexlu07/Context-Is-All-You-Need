      <body>From Sila:  Indeed. I spoke with Dave amidst the chaos of work. He hasn't gotten either of our emails yet because he apparently has like 300 about the jazzfest week. But I'll keep talking to Bob (the owner) about it, I work with him again this weekend. Just so he can give Dave that extra push in our direction.
Hang tight. Xo</body>
