      <body>Yeah man. So, I talked to Michael and I'm not going to work next week bc I have some other jobs. If you'd like to put in that door I can give you a day. Also if you're interested in hooking up the electric for Greg's mini split I'm gonna try to get to that next week as well. I'm not totally sure but I'll keep you posted. </body>
