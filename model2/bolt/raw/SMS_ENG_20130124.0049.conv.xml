      <body>Hey Ariel, sorry I haven't gotten back to you! A friend of mine passed away unexpectedly last weekend and, well, it's been awful. I rode Andy once more - he was a good boy, stiff to the left though, and when I was done I saw that he'd been sinking up to his ankles. This week everything's frozen solid. Hope you're doing well!</body>

      <body>Yikes I bet it's cold down there. It sure is here. I'm so sorry for the loss of your friend :( hopefully a snuggle with Lego and Andy can make you smile during this difficult time. Thank you for the update</body>
