      <body>Woooo very excited for that. Well, remember how I decided not to move out and to make good with Mel and Alice? Well Mel's being pretty shitty, to put it one way, and even after i asked to move back and stating my intentions wants me to move out. She got a cat without asking either so now i cant really be in the house at all. Really emotional convo.Â More to tell but I'm fine - just want to talk through it when possible.</body>

      <body>Well after talking it seems like everyone wanted to keep talking about it, no decision either way - but I lost trust and respect after seeing mel's mean girl behavior and I think I deserve better in a living situation. So! I think it is best.</body>
