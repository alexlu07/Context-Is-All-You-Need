      <body>I feel that it mostly bogs down because the belt is somewhat loose/worn. Have you ever tuned it up?</body>

      <body>I burned my belt up and replaced it several years ago I think the new one is slightly different and a little too long or something. But there's no reason not to get 3hp table saw for woodshop if you are going to be ripping thick and hard stock. </body>

      <body>Yeah, I've been researching how to get things precise and am gonna grab a feeler gauge and some other stuff when setting up the shop next week. If you wanna come see how I do it you can borrow my stuff. It's not rocket science. </body>
