      <body>Thanks for your text, ##### It's been a tough week. My mom's in hospice care now and is slowly slipping over to the other side. Not sure how long she's got. Maybe days, maybe weeks. The up side is that I get to spend time with my dad, brothers and nieces. Not sure when I'll be back in Philly, but I'll surely be due for a beer or two. Say hi to D for me. xxS</body>
