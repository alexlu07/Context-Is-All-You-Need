      <body>Hi! Of course! There is a price list. Also, I will be having another reception at the Crane and they will hang there for a month too. I'm willing to negotiate the prices for friends too, and certainly willing to accept small monthly payments too. How are Your shows going?? My roommate just applied to mambo btw and he's totally great! You'd love him.</body>
