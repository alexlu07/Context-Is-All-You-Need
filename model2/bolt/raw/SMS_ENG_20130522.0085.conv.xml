      <body>I am very sorry about that. I had texted you last night about the car and you said you didn't need it. I assumed that was all day. You didn't mention the need for the car in the evening and I completely forgot about your schedule. It is always changing. Hard to keep up with.</body>

      <body>I understand. I'll try to be more specific next time. I don't mind biking but just to go earlier. </body>
