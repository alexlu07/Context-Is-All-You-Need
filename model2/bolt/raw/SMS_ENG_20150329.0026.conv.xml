      <body>Ohh, I meant that last comment to be for excitement lol.. And I don't know where film Jacob and I stand, but whatever happens in life happens :) we have nice conversations and stuff, and I clearly like him but I don't know what he feels and since I'm leaving for two months I don't know what he thinks about me and him maybe becoming more than friends. I sent him a message via Facebook saying bye because we left our apartment today and he never replied so I don't know.   

And what is your boy like? </body>

      <body>Oh word❤️❤️❤️ ... He's everything a young Jenna ever dreamed of. Foreign, talk, dark, handsome, smart and genuinely cares about me in a way I don't even know how to handle because I completely misjudged him when we first met and thought he was rude and devious but he's not... He's so incredibly sweet. And he's in film:) </body>
