      <body>Dead areas effect the fruction of the brain. .. example frontal lobe controls memory and attention.  So lesions there can cause my memory to be bad. .. parietal lobes (sides) control language. Could explain why I have been mixing up words. Like I been calling objects by wrong names</body>
