      <body>Hey hey hey! Ugh I don't even know where to begin!  I haven't felt stress like this in a while. Just trying to keep my head above water. How's nutrition? I saw Gabby the other day! She said she spoke to you recently. It was so unexpected and random! Haven't seen her in so long!</body>

      <body>Haha. Well that's so nice! When I go to campus I won't see anyone cause I'll only be able to go at night. But yeah, I thought about her so I figured I'd ask how she was doing. Nutrition is too fast paced for me. I go to bed at like 1, wake up at 5, spend 9 hours with babies, go home, and do it all over again. Haha</body>
