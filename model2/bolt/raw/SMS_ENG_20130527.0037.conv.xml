      <body>Hey there! Congrats on graduating! :) Are you going to be home at all this week so I can see you? Also, if you happen to be home this Friday, would you have any interest in helping me load the moving truck Friday afternoon/evening for $8/hr? My dad says he's "getting old" or something and we could use help :P</body>
