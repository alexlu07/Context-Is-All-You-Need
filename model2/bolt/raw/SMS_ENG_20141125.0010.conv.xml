      <body>Omg I just watched this video of this kid who was opening gifts in Christmas. His family was struggling financially and when he opened his gift, it was a cutting board. He was so freaking grateful and was like oh I can't wait to cut food on this , thank you! And then his parents were like all right now open this one.. And they saved up enough money and got him a tablet. I freaking cried.. It was so stinkin sweet and he was so happy. I can't even think about it. Id buy that kid a computer and pay for his internet haha</body>
