      <body>I think she's looking to make a little money... Her financial aid package wasn't very big for college, but she might be down just to work with the animals anyway, I'll see what's up. I'll be back in May and we will totally do something!!! Also I finally finished the book you lent me... Sooo good. Have you read the sequel yet? </body>

      <body>Ok. She normally just traded for lessons but there is a lot to do around the barn so she might be willing to pay. Aww glad you liked it! Yep I've read both sequels. You will be super surprised!!! </body>
