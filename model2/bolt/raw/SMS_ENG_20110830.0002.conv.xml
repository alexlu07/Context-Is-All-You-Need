      <body>Sorry I fell asleep. No there's no need to compare nor any gain but there is a need to know your own worth as much as possible without Phillips words. You are a universe (and an ant...) of your own talents and loves and needs and it would be simplifying a beautiful complicated constellation to compare it. </body>
