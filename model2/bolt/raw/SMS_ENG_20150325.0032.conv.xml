      <body>Not sure of the fine. It's always easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.</body>

      <body> Yeah I figure if I can get it done and get fined a few hundred dollars that is still a lot better than 7 thousand</body>

      <body>As long as your neighbors are cool and you don't get a lot of traffic, you should be cool. Just make sure the hole is covered if you leave it open overnight. The parking authority looks out for that shit now.</body>

      <body>The pile is ok...tell them you're just replacing your sidewalk. Cover with plywood &amp; caution tape is great.</body>
