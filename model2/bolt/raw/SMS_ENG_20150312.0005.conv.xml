      <body>His systolic shouldn't  be higher than 120. Otherwise, as he ages, his Bp will get higher, and that spells trouble. Has he checked his kidney function, both BUN and creatinine?</body>

      <body>i don’t think so. I will let him know. He is a special case, though, because he has a neurological tremor. So, this might be why his bp is so high. He is also genetically predisposed to high bp. He needs to be on a full dosage of his medication, but it causes the ringing in his years to get worse. He is working with a doctor on that - I think he might need to try a different medication (yet again).</body>
