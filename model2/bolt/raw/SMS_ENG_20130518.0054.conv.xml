      <body>Hey Liza, I'm sorry I didn't let you know earlier. I was hoping things would work out but I couldn't get the money and timing together to make it out there for your graduation. I had a bunch of unexpected problems with my study abroad and class schedule  and expenses come up. I hope you'll forgive me for saying I would be there and not following through.</body>
