      <body>Years ago when Wegmans came in and spoke to us about recommending their food they did mention that is was made by Purina. Another brand which seems to get good reviews is the brand sold by Tractor Supply. If you are looking for a brand with the highest quality control (and probably highest priced) then I would look at Royal Canin</body>
