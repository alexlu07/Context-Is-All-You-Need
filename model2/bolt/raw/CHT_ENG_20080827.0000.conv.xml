      <body>Hmmm... Doesn't look like it.  Write me sometime.  Sam and I broke up a few days ago.  I'm in Philly still, packing up my stuff and figuring out some new plans.  We're both a bit of a mess.  I'd really like to hear from some old friends.  So would Sam, I'm sure.  Take care Eric, talk to you soon.</body>
