      <body>Hey just I saw this thing on tv and it leads me to believe your bird in the garden will most likely have the opposite affect you desire.  Some people use those things to hunt cause it attracts birds.   ...not quite the Owl effect you want.  Figured I'd let you know.  ...if it matters.</body>
