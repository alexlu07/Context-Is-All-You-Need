      <body>Sounds great. I need your email address, full name and credit card info. If u want to leave it on my voice mail that's fine. Or if u would like me to call you I can. I need the number, expiration date and 3 digit code on the back. The billing address and zip code. If its your parents card I need their info. The comb we use is $15 and there will be a $15 travel fee, that $30 goes directly to Raquel by check or cash. Let me know if that's an issue. -Merav</body>

      <body>Merav, I'll call you in a little.  Thanks for following up!!!! Raquel was great, she did a great job! My roommate checked me this afternoon and she only found four nits! Which is amazing, considering yesterday we were finding four every other strand.  This has been a nightmare,  I'm not sure what I would have done if you  hadnt sent Raquel to check me... Probably would have lice for a lot longer.  Thanks. </body>
