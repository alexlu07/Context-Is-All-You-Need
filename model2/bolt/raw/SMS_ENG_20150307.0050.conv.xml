      <body>￼So funny story with this pic. I always had the idea to pack all of my clothes in these contractor bags. It's so easy. Pull off of the rack and into the bag then just as easy to undo. I finally get around to helping my sister pack since I graduated before her and we would always have different schedules. She's like ugh I hate packing my shirts. I ask why? It's such an easy thing. She's like gosh you have to take off each hanger, fold everything nicely, pack it, move, unpack, maybe iron, then redo each hanger. I find a contractor bag and drop all of her stuff in less than a minute. She freaks the fuck out. WHY HAVEN'T I BEEN DOING THAT ALL OF THESE YEARS. WHAT THE SHIT?!</body>
