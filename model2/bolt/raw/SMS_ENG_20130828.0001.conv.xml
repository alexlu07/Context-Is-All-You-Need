      <body>Hey Gabi, remember when I said 7:30 PM would be okay? Looks like I can't do it. How about we shoot for Saturday morning? Josh mentioned that's the soonest you could get in anyway. Any time in the morn is fine (I have an early bird 3-year old).</body>

      <body>Housekeeping items to plan for: I'll need 1st month's rent, signatures on W9 &amp; lease, then I owe you keys. We'll do a quick run-through on the remaining work we're doing too (nothing to impede move-in though).</body>
