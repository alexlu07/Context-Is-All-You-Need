      <body>Hey gabi! This is Dan your bass student. Hannaford scheduled me 4-9 tonight so I can't come in for recording. I'm going to ask for Mondays off from now on so we can work on the recording though. I also have a form that needs to be signed by you tonight regarding my project so I was hoping I could swing by during my break. It's super important! </body>
