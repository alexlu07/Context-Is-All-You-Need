      <body>In so many ways, she's told me she's out of it like all the time for the past few weeks, she's been weirdly in her own head, she's like pushing away from everything, she's apathetic about a lot of stuff, etc</body>

      <body>Great, weird, the stoop group hasn't changed much, saw Mario- he is literally the exact same, with no stories. Went to Sasha's leftover party, which was fun but also weird. I feel like I have had a much longer 3 months than a lot of people</body>

    <message id="m0020" participant="136164" time="2012-11-29 02:48:34 UTC">
      <body>Yeah probably. I feel the same way. I saw some pictures of the stoop group on Facebook and I was just like, "what's changed for them?" Seems like nothing. It's also strange to put a high school semester into the perspective of a college semester. </body>

      <body>They have been good. I feel very comfortable and settled in here. I feel like I've learned some things and met some great people. I haven't really been homesick at all, but at this point I'm ready for a break and a change of pace for next semester. </body>
