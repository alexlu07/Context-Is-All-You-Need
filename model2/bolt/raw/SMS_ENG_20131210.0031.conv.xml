      <body>Just making sure bec a gift should be something she likes not something you like bec it can come off as you wanting to change her... but if its only one item and you got her other things its not a big deal</body>

      <body>Yeah that's what I was afraid of. I told her she doesn't have to wear something for me but she said she would like them too. I don't know what else to get her yet</body>

      <body>The only thing with getting a girl a shoe is whether or not she has an outfit to go with it. If she doesn't wear sneakers,  her current wardrobe might not do causing her to not wear them</body>

      <body>Ok that's fine.  Just tell her that if she doesn't like em she can return them. Most likely she won't but as long as you let her know that its not a pressure way of giving her something you like.  Ya know?  Like a psychological way of gift giving lol</body>
