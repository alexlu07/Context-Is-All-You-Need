      <body>Dang, that sounds like a really nice idea. Not quite sure if I actually know anybody that owns a projector though. I think the best idea would be to get one at Best Buy, use it for the night and then just return it the next day. Shouldn't be a problem.  Just double check their policy.  I don't see it being an issue as long as yr gentle with it.</body>
