      <body>Well I wouldn't have a 'home' I would be a tss in different schools within the philly school district but there isn't really a guarantee that my current position will be there coming the new school year because it seems as if they are fading my program. Like I really can't learn anymore where I'm at. </body>

      <body>It's like I'm trying to talk myself into it even though I know I should do it. I figure if I make the move instead of them making it for me I will feel better about it. And it's the freaking university of penn!</body>

      <body>It's okay for me to have hung up on manny and not to talk to him for a day probably more because when I was trying to say how am I going to work and do this practicum and he responded with 'just roll with it' and then started talking about how many views a video had??? </body>

    <message id="m0014" time="2015-04-09 01:27:28 UTC" participant="153424">
      <body>Crystal I was seriously livid. Like pretend to have some respect for my life and problems. He was like 'are you really mad!?' Umm yes I'm really effing mad. I like to every little detail of his day and then something important like this gets that response? </body>
    </message>
    <message id="m0015" time="2015-04-09 01:32:07 UTC" participant="153417">
      <body>Yeah I'd be mad too. How could he just brush it off like that and act like he doesn't care. That's irritating. I feel like you 2 have known each other long enough to a genuine interest in what's going on in your lives, especially something like this</body>

      <body>But you're right. I was left wondering does he even know what I do for a living. Like how can you just brush me off like I was completely boring you and you had no time for me. </body>

      <body>But yeah you have every right to be mad. He's stupid if he thinks your mad for some dumb reason. What he did was hurtful and you shouldn't let him slide. </body>

    <message id="m0021" time="2015-04-09 01:41:55 UTC" participant="153424">
      <body>Haha that's what I figured. He is watching the Phillies game... I was really hurt. Like complete strangers at least pretend to have some interest. And I'll be damned if he thinks I'm calling him. Like he is the one who owes me an apology </body>

      <body>I need to just let this go. But after I told him I was going to hang up, two days ago. He never even attempted to contact me. Not a text or call. If I know someone is mad at me. I try to make it right. I hate that he decided if I needed space or not </body>

    <message id="m0030" time="2015-04-09 11:08:14 UTC" participant="153424">
      <body>Haha you are by association. Like he is going to call when he needs something and expects me to want to talk to him and pretend like nothing is wrong. He will never approach the topic and if I bring it up in dramatic </body>

    <message id="m0035" time="2015-04-09 11:20:13 UTC" participant="153424">
      <body>I mean I'm literally stressing the eff out. It's no joke I have to make sure they give me a schedule that gives me insurance etc. and I would have liked just so acknowledgement that it was stressful and would be okay. Or just the fact that he could have listened </body>
    </message>
    <message id="m0036" time="2015-04-09 11:24:06 UTC" participant="153417">
      <body>Yeah I agree. So we're either both crazy or both right. I'd go with the latter.</body>

    <message id="m0037" time="2015-04-09 11:26:56 UTC" participant="153424">
      <body>Oh we are both right. He could have ignored me. It's the principle of that fact that his response mid my sentence was 'oh wow look how many views this video got'.. You can't be serious </body>
