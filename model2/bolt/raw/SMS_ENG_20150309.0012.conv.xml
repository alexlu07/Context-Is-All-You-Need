      <body>Hey! So I'm applying to jobs right now, and I know we haven't decided on my title/all my responsibilities at Bonnie yet, but would it be okay if I listed myself as maybe a project manager, or some kind of managerial position? I know you wanted my role to shift towards that eventually right?</body>

      <body>Okay great, thank you! For lack of time/laziness I will just say manager for the time being and then come up with something more specific later. Hope I see you soon btw! </body>
