      <body>! Thank you for calling! I haven't been alone bc I have friends from out of town staying with me, but I will call you right back as soon as I'm alone. I've been looking at a lot of George Bellows recently!! ￼His figures by swimming holes!? I've never seen those! I had only seen the boxing scenes </body>
