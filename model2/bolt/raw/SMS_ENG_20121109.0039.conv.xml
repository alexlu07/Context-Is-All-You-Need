      <body>Hey folks, I'm still too sick to teach and really shouldn't be doing anything, but I thought we could rehearse here at rose st tonight, phin can lead rehearsal and I can lay on a couch and hop up when I need to, we could also start earlier, ESP for pieces like masochism tango and tap. 7:30?Â I don't have Suzie, Loren or Nicolette on this phone list, I will send an email, but if peeps have their digits, can you pass it on?</body>

      <body>Ps. 9:30 is still fine if that's all you can do, the more of us here early, the easier, then we can just insert the rest. I also got us all free passes to tonight's show at signal kitchen, if you wanna go grab a beer and observe the space, I wont go but you all should!!!</body>
