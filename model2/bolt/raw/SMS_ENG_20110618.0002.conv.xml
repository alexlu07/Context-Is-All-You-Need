      <body>I'm so sorry that I haven't been available to see you! I had two weddings out of town and I have worked/am working both colleges' reunion teen programs. Meaning zero weekends free in the last month to see my Martha! :( I might be in uptown for a few hours tomorrow afternoon. Any chance you're free?</body>
