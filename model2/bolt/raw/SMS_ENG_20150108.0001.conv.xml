      <body>I saw Georgeanne today. She's in the ICU so I couldn't talk to her long but she said that her boss is busy. Two new people just started. But she said that she is her "boss's hemorrhoid" and to keep texting her. She will be so mad if she doesn't give me a chance. So I still have to wait and see.</body>
