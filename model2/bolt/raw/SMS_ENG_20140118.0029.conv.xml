      <body>Ok you also have to realize 1- that dawn is going thru withdraw. Cigarettes are like drugs.  They contain an addictive drug. Her going thru withdraw is going to take effect on her.... when I quit smoking I snapped on anyone who even said hi to me. I was going crazy bec my body stopped getting something it was needing. I couldn't control iy.... 2- if she is snapping and you embarrassed her by calling her rude in front of someone else of course she is only going to get more pissed off and embarrass you too...</body>
