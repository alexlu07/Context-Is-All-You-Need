      <body>Just now saw the FB post about Q's car accident. Fuck! Sooo glad she's okay (physically). How is she otherwise? I'd imagine she'd be pretty shook up.
You okay?</body>

      <body>She's ok. Doc gave her Valium. Expect that she will be sore but X-rays show no damage...thank goodness. She is emotionally fine...the accident was in Tracy's car with Randall and lil sis Kenna. Everyone is fine. They were on the way to get Cass so luckily</body>
