      <body>Dear Sofie, how's everything? I wanna let you know that I can't go to school today because my boyfriend is sick and wants me to be home with him. He is too weak to talk and move so he now asks me for water/food by knocking the wall </body>

      <body>Hmmm maybe I should try... But yesterday I let him at home cuz I had to bring something to your new place (we're supposed to move this week...) I was only out for 3 hours and he called with a dying voice that I couldn't barely recognize and said "When are you coming home?! I'm dying...."  I was like what?! I'm only out for 3 hours! </body>
