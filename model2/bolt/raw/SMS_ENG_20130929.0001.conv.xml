      <body>Howdy. I got out of Beau around 10:15 and headed directly to a dog-sit I'm doing tonight &amp; all this week on 2nd and American. Exhausted from my trip and needed of get horizontal - not much of a vacation, sadly. My mom's doing a little better, though. Happy to get you food anytime, so let me know when you're hungry:-) We should cook sometime too. We'll see each other soon, I'm sure. Have a good night!</body>
