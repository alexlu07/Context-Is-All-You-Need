      <body>good idea to email them and if you dont hear back call. but it might be better to reschedule for fri. kids might stay home all day today and not go at all</body>

      <body>Hmm good point. I will ask about that. Hopefully we'll hear back! Especially in your case with only 3 students it might make more sense to reschedule</body>

      <body>Looks like it's fine for you and lakisha to go in today, 2 hours later than your originally scheduled arrival time...I'm assuming you'll still have time to meet with the 3 students, the asst principal doesn't seem to anticipate attendance issues. </body>
