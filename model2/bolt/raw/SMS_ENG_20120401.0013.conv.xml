      <body>Hey, sorry, I just saw this. I don't think that would be a problem, as long as I get a chance to set up my other futon. You'd be amazed at how much unpacking I still have left</body>

      <body>Are you sure? I'm sure someone else will let me couch surf if need be. I don't want to make you rush your unpacking. I'm not done with that either!</body>
