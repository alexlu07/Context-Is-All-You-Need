      <body>Trust yourself. When you start getting anxious just tell yourself its only a waiting job.if you are nice to people andyou are trying you're hardest that's all you can do. So think, I'm a good person and I'm doing my best. You can do it....breathe and say to yourself, I'm a good person.  I love you</body>

      <body>Believe in who you are.....you're a pretty amazing person. Just think of all the places you've been and all your experiences. Seriously...you have been on stage in front of hundred of people...singing and acting. You've memorized thousands of lines and lyrics. You've been all over the world!  And know how much I love you</body>
