      <body>Please confirm it was Eileen who took the cable box out of the apartment. It was by the living room window floor the night before last but not last night. Not sure if Urban and Bye took it. I also think I'll get a different wifi provider with Julia. I was trying to figure that out this week. Happy New Year!!!</body>
