      <body>Haha I printed out a lot of my arguments and I had a lot of arguments. So when I had like 4 accordions that was really intimidating. Because nobody can see how many args you have on your computer, but when it's on paper they can tell. The only round it was ridiculous in was this one round my junior year where I pulled out 3 accordions and a computer and my opponent had her laptop and two of her teammates laptops and one accordion. </body>
