      <body>Why are you getting a meal plan?</body>
    </message>

      <body>I figured it'd be easier to just get lunch and maybe dinner there if I have to. It'll save on time and be more convenient to use my Wildcard. But as it turns out, they don't even offer a meal plan for commuters during the summer! I called dining services and a person told me a price that was pretty outrageous, but the contact person for the program said they don't have one. Boo :(</body>

      <body>I would just put money on your wildcard and do that. I believe they overcharge for the meal plans.</body>

      <body>Yea, I was thinking about that after she told me they don't have one for people like me hahah. Might be the only way to go. I was shocked when the woman from dining services told me a price. Like okay, I don't think I'll be eating here THAT much for it to be worth it!</body>
