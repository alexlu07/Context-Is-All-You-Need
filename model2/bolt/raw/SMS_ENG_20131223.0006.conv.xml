      <body>Hello my friends! So this is a long ways away, but I'm excited for it and it is time sensitive. So I saw on Groupon that there is a deal on tickets for the OneRepublic &amp; The Script concert this summer. It's funny because I've been into this new song by the former for the last few days, hence the excitement!! And yes, I listen to their other songs, along with songs from The Script (I'm talking to you Michael)! The deal is for General Admission-lawn for $13.50!!! The regular prices were at least double. It's on Saturday, June 28th at 7. The thing is, the deal is over in 18 hours so I need answers ASAP. Please text me back so I know you got my text. If not, I'll call just in case I didn't get your response because of my phone. Ahhhh #countingstars</body>
