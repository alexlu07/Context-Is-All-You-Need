      <body>Omg muff, it's like we were speaking different languages :/ I tried to commuicate something during table work but was too round-about so I talked to her privately on break to let her know that it's vital for my character's trajectory that aloyisius doesn't cross the line into cruelty. Of course she felt like I was stepping on her toes n seeeethed "and you need to leave that decision to meeee!" I said "thank you" and walked away. She's been kind ever since. I think we're on the verge of a break through ;)</body>
