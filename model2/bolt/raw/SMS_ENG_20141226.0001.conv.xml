      <body>Oh Jenny. We just got done eating and are about to walk back home. We are so so stuffed and tired and don't really feel like going back out. We're lazy bums right now. Do you mind if we just see everyone on Monday? And if anything changes you can still come out to dinner with us tomorrow night.</body>
