      <body>Good afternoon! So i did put up a temp fence so you don't have to worry about leashing oti when the dogs go out. I would still only let them out together though. What time do you think you'll get her tomorrow? We're not sure we need someone to stop in. We won't have to leave until a more reasonable hour</body>

      <body>Aw thanks for the fence!! Realistically I will probably get there closer to 5:30 because students always want to talk after class. </body>

      <body>Okay. Great. Lol with the fence. We've separated the wild animals from the domestic now :) Finn stands there and looks longingly into the back. His patrols have been thwarted.</body>
