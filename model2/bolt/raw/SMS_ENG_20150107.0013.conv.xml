      <body>I had the most fun/weird dream last night. It was you and me doing a performance art piece about menstruation!!! It was inspired by a "real" experience you had where your period started at the coop and you just let yourself bleed (all over yourself and into the floor). People were so impressed with your menstrual courage that we decided to use it as the foundation for our show! I remember I was going to use some instruments and you had a lot of potted plants. </body>

      <body>Duh! I bet the plants in the dream were those that are used to support healthy menstruation (what I've been researching and writing about). Plants for Menstrual Courage! I've been toying with the idea of a zine for awhile and now I think I have a title. Maybe someday you can make a companion video for the zine (when it finally comes all together)! </body>
