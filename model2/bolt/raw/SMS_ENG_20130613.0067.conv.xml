      <body>hey! i havr a question. if i am given a X(f) eqn and asked to find x(n) how should i approach it. for eg: X(F) = 2+10cos(2pif)-6cos(4pif). </body>

      <body>i though of writing X(f) in terms of exponentials..and then taking the FT of it..then il get shifted impulses. and then i did.that Cn= foX(nfo)..

      <body>FT of cos and delta also exist. They're shifted deltas.</body>

      <body>you can also break it down into exponentials first. Both ways work.</body>

      <body>d x(n),,was the question in the final - related to the ln question difficult? i knw u said it wasnt ln , but was it hard? </body>

      <body>That ln problem is nothing more than some tricky algebra to make it look like a FT pair.</body>

      <body>ya the ln is easy..because we know how to do it already..but was not sure if he will give a weird looking function where we have no clue of how to approach it</body>
