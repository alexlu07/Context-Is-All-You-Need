      <body>hey hey! Jane’s actually on hold trying to get a new flight since all flights leaving today for boston have been cancelled, so our day opened up. Once we get done with that, we have were going to go grab something to eat at grindcore house with a friend who is vegan, but otherwise day wide open. I assume you don’t want vegan bagels in place of colin’s bagels (i know i wouldn’t...) but you’re welcome to join us there.</body>
