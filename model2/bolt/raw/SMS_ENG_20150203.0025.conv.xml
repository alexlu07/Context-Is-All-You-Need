      <body>I'm fine, thanks. But remember when my car was "stolen"/towed? Well I just got home from the PPA and it turns out that they don't even have that on record! The people who towed my car was a private company. Furthermore, the police department that sent the notification had no right to tow my car because of an inspection. I asked the Senior Director earlier and he said that the PPA is the one that deals with inspections and towing and I have proof that they took my car because of an inspection! He was that I should stay on top of this, keep the notice or warning, and contact an attorney.</body>
