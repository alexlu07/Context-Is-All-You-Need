      <body>Hey man. I'm not good with working after 6 or 7. I'm registering for a illustrator workshop at Uarts in February so I will pick up some skills there, but there are a couple of things I wanted to get done in the meantime. Just let me know when you have an hr or 2 during the daytime on a weekend or whenever. I'm pretty much done with work til the 3rd or 4th of jan starting on Friday </body>
