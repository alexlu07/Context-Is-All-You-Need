      <body>Tumblr etiquette help...if someone "asks" that they think you're cool (in a platonic way), do you answer "thanks i think youre cool (platonically) too" privately or publicly? Also I'm excited I might get to see you this weekend! :)</body>

      <body>Whichever is fine. If you want it to show up on your blog, do it publicly. If it doesn't feel right there, private is fine. </body>
