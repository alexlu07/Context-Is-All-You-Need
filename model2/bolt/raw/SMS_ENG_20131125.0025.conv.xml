      <body>" I wouldn't mind chipping in for anything but I'm pretty sure a tv isn't something either of them want or need.  Considering he calls my tv a "fancy tv" and looks down on anyone with  modern conveniences I'm pretty sure dad wouldn't even appreciate that he might not even accept it"</body>
