      <body>Left a check in your trunk for August :) also, if you're ok with dollar getting the fly supplement, I'm happy to pay for it. It's pellets so I'll try feeding it to him by hand so there's some chance that he eats it! </body>

      <body>I am worried that he will stop eating if there is something he deems as alien in his food! I don't mind if they try it in food, but if he hates it, we would want to stop putting it in.
Thanks for paying for it:)</body>
