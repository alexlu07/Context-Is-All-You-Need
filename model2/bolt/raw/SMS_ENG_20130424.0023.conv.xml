      <body>Ugh sounds like you've got a full plate. Also, shouldn't your prof have warned the class first at least to let people leave, etc?? I'm alright. Kinda stressed with all the study abroad stuff I have to do and figuring out my life. But today was a good day. Spent most of it sharing absurd stories with Alex( or chunky, I don't know if you met her, she's a friend of niths). And guess who I ran into?</body>

      <body>I ran into Gullome. I was all quick Needham people, look away. But he's a real person now; it was wicked weird. Apparently he knows my sister well too. That's  good about your prof though. </body>
