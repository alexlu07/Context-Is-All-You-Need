      <body>Lol. I'd like to know what I'm paying for. Is it a set menu? An estimation? I don't really care if he gets drinks. He shouldn't be drinking anyway</body>

      <body>Google the place for menu. Just an estimate. Its like fogo. Its outlined exactly what the 35 goes towards. Only a small amount of that is expected to go to drinks unless we go far over our expected number of guests</body>
