      <body>Oh.  I had no idea.  He seemed salty he didn't hear about it from you guys. I just told him it wasn't really like a 'thing' or anything, it just popped up. I feel stupid.  I didn't know what to say or anything.  If you'd like to have a girl's weekend tho I don't mind hanging out here or anything. It's really not a big deal or anything at all. I just want my loved peeps to be all good.  Sorry, I hope I'm not a burden with that stuff.</body>
