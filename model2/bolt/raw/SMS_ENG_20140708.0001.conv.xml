      <body>What is your availability on thurs the 10th? I am supposed to do an install in old city but am sick with stomach problems and can't get much further than my bed and the bathroom today. Hopefully I will be better by 9am on the 10th but I wanted to have a backup in place if I was unable to make it or needed assistance due to shitting my brains nonstop.</body>
