      <body>Hey- I just saw your Instagram photo. Just be careful, Lilly's can cause serious health issues in cats. We got a long list of plants that are toxic to cats and Lilly's are serious. The flowers are beautiful, though!</body>

      <body>I know, it sucks!! I just emailed a photo of that list to you. There was an article in the news not long ago about a cat having kidney failure because it ate a Lilly. :( sorry to be such a downer, but I didn't want you to have to go through that.</body>
