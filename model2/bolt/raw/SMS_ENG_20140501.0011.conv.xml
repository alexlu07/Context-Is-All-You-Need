      <body>It wasn't too bad. I was prepared with the rainboots and umbrella. But it was insane. Everything was and still is flooded. How about you? Did you go to work? I imagine people were driving very....dumb.</body>

      <body>Hahah I didn't have to go outside yesterday (thank goodness). I was going to but after hearing what was going on outside, I decided to barricade myself inside instead. But as I was driving to work today, I saw a good amount if flooding in Jersey. Craziness.</body>

      <body>I know. I heard on the news they were saying if you have to go to work, leave a lot earlier. Craziness.</body>
