      <body>Hey, I hope this is ok to ask but Caitlin's 30th birthday is coming up soon and I know she really really wants the new iPhone. I'm trying to get a bunch of folks to pitch in $10-$20 to get it. I'm gonna pitch in for the phone and on my own have a custom case made for her. If you already have something else planned then don't sweat doing this as well. Let me know if yer in or out. 
Oh yea, I forgot! I also thought maybe having all the folks names who contributed put somewhere on the case like the inside or something? I dunno, thoughts?</body>
