      <body>I'm going for it. (I had a couple glasses of wine instead). Part of doing this is that I feel like I need to take a chance on something. Big moves are scary but getting trapped scares me more. </body>

      <body>Getting trapped is scary.  Mike a classmate of mine from taiwan sent me this: "Sofie, when I was in junior high school, a teacher told me, if you feel good, that means you're going down; if you feel you're struggling, it means you're going up. It's like climbing a mountain."</body>
