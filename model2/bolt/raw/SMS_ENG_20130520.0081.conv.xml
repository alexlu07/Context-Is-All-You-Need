      <body>Nice! Sounds like a wonderful birthday! :) do you have your own apartment in Philly now? So exciting about the job! I'm working at L'OCCITANE, a French beauty boutique and I'm absolutely loving it! Subletting an apartment in Brighton until I move in with my queer feminist friends on September 1st. I've also been seeing someone for the past couple of months! Not exclusively, just dating casually, but I like her a lot. :)</body>
