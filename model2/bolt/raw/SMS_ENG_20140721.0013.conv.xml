      <body>I wish we night more kibble and bits bec he loves those, maybe ge would have eaten then regardless lol. But I meant to tell you that the dog food in the Chinese container on the kitchen counter are treats for when he comes in from the yard. Rewarding him for that prevents him from being spiteful in the house</body>
