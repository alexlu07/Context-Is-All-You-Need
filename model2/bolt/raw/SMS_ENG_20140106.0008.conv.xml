      <body>I'm splitting the pile with Michael so prices aren't fully fleshed out yet but I think we could do the 60"x45" 5 shelf units for $250 and the 48" x36" 5 shelf units for around $200 or so. It's just gonna be a pain in the ass to divy them up, store them, deliver them etc. </body>

      <body>Ok. I think we're getting 14 large and 5 of the smaller ones. They are quickly being snagged up so let me know the verdict as soon as you know. 2 or three of the larger ones might be a slightly different size</body>
