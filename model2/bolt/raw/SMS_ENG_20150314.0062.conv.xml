      <body>Hahaha if only. So he's so boring that conversation dropped off at lunch so I just kept drinking water. Like gallons of it. Then I'm like uh I think I need to meet some friends at grand central so peace out and he's like oh I'll walk you. So we're walking through Central Park aka wasteland of no public restrooms when I'm like oh shit I have to pee. So I head toward 5th hoping to find a Starbucks, but there's only this fancy Italian restaurant so I hand the dude my umbrella and I'm like wait here. And so I run in and I'm like Do you have a restroom I can please use and the host is like take the elevator down two floors. So I'm potty dancing in the elevator when I reach the illustrious golden bathroom complete with perfume ladies and powders when I lose control of my bladder. And this old Asian perfume lady takes pity on me and gives me the next available stall and hands me a bunch of paper towels under the door</body>
