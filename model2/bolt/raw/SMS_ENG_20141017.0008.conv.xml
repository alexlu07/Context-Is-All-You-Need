      <body>I called Cindy again today &amp; left another message.  I then spoke to Beth for awhile.  She said she was going to call you.  Did you hear from her?  </body>

      <body>It's a little hard to explain in a text but Beth is a bed bug expert.  Cindy isn't. Beth would be treating this but she blew out her knee. </body>

      <body>If she talks to you &amp; asks questions she might be able to figure out why Cindy's treatments have been ineffective.  </body>

      <body>OK. The other is kind of a long shot but it is an outside chance that you guys keep visiting another place that has bed bugs &amp; bringing them back with you.  But I'm pretty certain that's not the case.  </body>

    <message id="m0015" time="2014-10-17 23:00:16 UTC" participant="152759">
      <body>I think this is either a chemical thing or what I think they are hiding in a place that she isn't getting to.  </body>

    <message id="m0017" time="2014-10-17 23:02:11 UTC" participant="152759">
      <body>Maybe but I think it's them getting past or around the dust / spray.  She did say she switched chemicals. </body>

      <body>Have you heard from Beth yet? I want to figure out why we are having such a tough time in your room.  Others have gotten bed bugs but no one seems to have gotten it nearly as bad as you have.  </body>
