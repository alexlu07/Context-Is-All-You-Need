      <body>Noah!  Yo. Hope you are well. Planning on shooing the rest of episode 2 and the entirety of 3 on May the 7th. A Monday. We could use your help. In the meantime we will need a few things. I will keep you posted. But we have a pressing matter. </body>

      <body>The sign ontop of the hour glass does not read. We shot the scene, but I need to plug the more clear sign in in post. You have some time in the next week to further carve it out or make it look more clear?</body>
