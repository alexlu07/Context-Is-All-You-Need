      <body>If u want/haven't found any among your desired extras--listed in Dad's fwded texts or otherwise, tell me. Did u find Liza box in Dedham with toaster oven? Do u have a multi-tool, or any tools &amp; hardware besides hammer &amp; pliers? That tiny screwdriver set can't give u any torque without handle length, and the tips are way too delicate for most jobs. I think I've figured out where more tools are. </body>
