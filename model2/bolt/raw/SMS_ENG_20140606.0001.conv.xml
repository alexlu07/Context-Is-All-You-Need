      <body>Hey-would you give me a call at lunch? I really need to treat Ruby, and there are two different treatment options (one is a 3-day for $90 and the other is a 7-day for $36), but they say to always treat both dogs in the household and they can't issue meds to Simone because she isn't a patient there. We need to act fast. </body>

      <body>Yes, but Panacur takes longer so if I treat with Drontal and it takes 3days, and you treat with Panacur   and ruby comes into contact with a cyst from Simone, she could get it again. </body>
