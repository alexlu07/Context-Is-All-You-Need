      <body>Prototyping conversation re the Coffee chat: dynamic share part 1.  The importance and lure of processing information In the "analog"? 


I am free except when I am in class, so u tell me when a good time is for you.  Topic is subject to change as is the buzz from the beer I had earlier.  

Please tell Cheryl that she either looks like someone I have known and cared for or I was close to her in another life. </body>

      <body>Will you be in the studio this weekend? Looking forward to our chat.

I am free after classes and after 7 on Thursdays (except this week). I could also meet early morning before work.

This work full time with three classes is difficult!</body>
