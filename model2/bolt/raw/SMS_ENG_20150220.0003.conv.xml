      <body>Ok so in all that we worked together I never remember you stressing about teaching. Always calm and collected. Was I that self-absorbed that I didn't notice? Like this shit is a lot of fucking work....</body>

      <body>It is a lot of work. You stress because you care, you want to do your best. Every school ( group of students) is different.... I have been lucky at Penn... they at least deliver....allow yourself to improvise... get better at it... that way you walk in with no expectations... it is all about the moment... shift shit... and be ok with it... be direct and flexible... stern but no rigid... it is a constant fight... all the time... and if you ever wanna chat... call me... totally feel free</body>
