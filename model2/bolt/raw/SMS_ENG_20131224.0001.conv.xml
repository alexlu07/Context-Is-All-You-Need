      <body>Hi Gabi! I'm here but don't think I need to be on phone for the whole meeting...just wanted to be involved in discussion on auditions, burlesque festival, and timing of spring 2014 start. Oh and I want to have a weekly prod meeting so if you guys could think/talk about that it would be awesome. Call if and when you want me!</body>
