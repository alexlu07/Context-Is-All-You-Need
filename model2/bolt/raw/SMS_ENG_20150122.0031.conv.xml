      <body>I was a lot worse... Sheridan's been very kind and let me fall apart over the phone for hours and then piece me back together. And I'm beginning to accept that life is taking me in a completely different direction. </body>

      <body>She says life will take its course and we don't know where we'll end up... Which I guess is true, but I am not about to ruin this incredible dynamic friendship on account of 14 years repressed feelings I didn't even know I was repressing. Right? </body>

      <body>Hmmmm okay. Ultimately, it's up to you. If it were me, I would be the same way. On the one hand, I would want to confess everything and see what happens. On the other hand, I would want to keep things the way they are because of what you said </body>

      <body>I guess it's a good thing I had this revelation now, when I don't have to see him for four months.  By that time I should have pulled it together and we'll all just look back on this and laugh at how crazy I was. </body>
