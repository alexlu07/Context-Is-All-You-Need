      <body>Gesine says: She said "he'd better not be dating someone" and that she would not want to know if he was, as it would just make her upset. If you think she will def find out anyways and prob in a bad way then mb still think about telling her, but otherwise I think it's best to let it be... What are your thoughts?</body>

      <body>I mean, yeah, actually if she said she wouldn't want to know, then we definitely shouldn't.</body>
