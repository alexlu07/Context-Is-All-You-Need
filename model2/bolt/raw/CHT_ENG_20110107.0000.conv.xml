      <body>OK, so good call on taking out the "It takes me a while to write back...be patient...blah, blah, blah..." from your profile. Don't get me wrong, it's cute that you try to act nice, really. I'm sure it's much more entertaining to read messages than respond to them. In order to make you "feel" better about not writing those losers back, allow me to let you in on a little OKC secret: It's perfectly OK to ignore messages. I use to be like you and say, "If someone writes me a half-decent, well-thought out message, I will write them back regardless of whether or not they are a 43 y/o single mother of four living in Milwaukee.". Now I know better. Besides, what the fuck are you going to say? Sure, you could write a message that just says "Not interested" in the subject, but that's kinda like rejection. I'd rather just not respond so then the person could think, "oh, I guess that nice person I messaged the other day died before they could write me back...shame."
