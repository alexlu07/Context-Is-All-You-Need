      <body>yeah the schedule looks so cool. congrats on being a distinguished alumni! maybe we could apply to that fest tmrw, I can upload the new version if I can remember how to do that. so you think it fits right? they say something about human interaction which made me question it. would it be academic or just documentary?</body>
