      <body>I didn't hear any gossip. All I could hear was my nail lady repeating over and over again "your nails are SO short!" like it was a revelation to me </body>

      <body>Lol. I love how direct they are. The funniest part is she was the last person to do my eyebrows. I always feel a little bad about myself when I leave diamond nails</body>

      <body>Ha! You should have told her. I got a haircut once and the girl was like, "did you cut your hair yourself before coming in?" And I was so happy to say, "no, you cut it last!" </body>
