      <body>Hi Lindsey: hope all is well.  Just needed to confirm the dates for the equipment lend, including pick up and drop off.  We are not able to lend any materials in our grip kit, including gels, and any project borrowing equipment is responsible for its own supplies including bulbs for lights. Please let me know if you need specs to order those.  
Look forward to catching up soon. L</body>

      <body>Hi Lisa! I will send you an email with our confirmed dates. I know we are still waiting to confirm one last date. And yes for the bulb specs. Wondering if bulbs will be as much as renting but will check! Thanks for this. Email to come soon</body>

      <body>Bulbs will be under $40 I think.  But since I have to pay for them out of my project funds, I have to ask the same of any project using the gear.  Sorry!</body>
