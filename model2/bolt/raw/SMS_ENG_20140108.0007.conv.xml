      <body>It was really nice the other day when we were at Hogwarts though. It was almost 80 degrees and I miss it! Today got cold again. We got to Epcot and parked the car, but we went back and drove back to the hotel to put on more layers because it was sooo cold here. Then again, I probably can't complain that much compared to what's going on up there. </body>
