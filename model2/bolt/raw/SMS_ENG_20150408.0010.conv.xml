      <body>That's SO FREAKING AWESOME!!! You're making the decisions now. I think that's so great!

I'm good. Classes are so far so good. We back from Easter break so there's not much work. I'm sure I'll be diving right into it though! My whole family has a stomach bug so I'm pretty much carrying Clorox wipes with me wherever I go. Literally. I hold it when I go into another room and disinfect </body>

      <body>Hey guys!!! So I know it's Sammy's bday this weekend, but I don't know if I'll be going out. That stomach bug has hit every single person in my family, including mike who is in DC. Plus, I'll jut feel awful if someone gets it from me </body>

      <body>Oh no worries. I'm actually okay right now, but it's most likely inevitable that I'll be getting it. </body>
