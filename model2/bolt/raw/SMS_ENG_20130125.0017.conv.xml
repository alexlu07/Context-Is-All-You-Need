      <body>Hannibal sent me after not answering my calls for days:
   There are no hard feelings and I'm not mad I still love you and want to be a part of your life but I am not worthy enough to stand next to you in the caacity that we had you most of all should understand this because we have discussed the topic several times and at some length bill bob mark and I will aways be there to rally to your banner (even though you are a Jew) we still love you I still love you and will be there for you but we must harden ourseles to this reality I love you dearly and do not want  current feelings to destroy our future companionship. Try to remember that I do care for you a lot My phone is dying so this will be it for a while I love you and will be there for you when your ready.</body>
