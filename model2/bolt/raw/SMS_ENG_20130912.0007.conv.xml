      <body>Hey Steph and I are thinking about maybe doing a halloween party this year.. we planned on decorating anyway... in that case it would be on sat oct 26 and you can invite all your friends,  whoever you want. So keep the date in mind but don't say anything yet just bec we want to make sure we are positive about it first</body>

      <body>But worst case if we don't have a party that night we might  still have a halloween gathering (a lot less ppl, like a small handful to come for snacks and drinks) if you still want to have some friends that night</body>
