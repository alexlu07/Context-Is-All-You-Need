      <body> So there was a question on my exam that I originally thought said identify if it was gram negative or positive, so I put + or - next to each bacteria. 

I later read that it actually asked which bacteria was affected by an certain antibiotic. I wrote on my exam "it targets gram + peptidoglycan," but I think I forgot to change the + and - to check marks on gram + bacteria only.
You think I'll lose all those points?</body>
