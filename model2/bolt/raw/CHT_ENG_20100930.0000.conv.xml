      <body>but our zodiac compatibility said "These two are opposites in the zodiac and are attracted to each other like magnets. They are both tireless, changeable and not frank enough as lovers. Gemini are inclined to criticize the Sagittarius' behavior in bed. They may be disappointed sexually, since neither is demonstrative-and Gemini is very quick to criticize. There are also some other weak points in their relationships while the strength is that they are both undemanding people. Their affair will probably begin impulsively and will be finished suddenly as well. The marriage can turn out to be quite good but it will require efforts from both of them. "</body>
