      <body>Ok, I think you could fit 4 images on 1 sheet if they are around 12" tall. Could you do an edition of more than 8? It's cool if you can't but I think I can definitely sell more than 8. I have the paper if you are available. I can give it to you Monday as well. I'm working on a house near fish town</body>
