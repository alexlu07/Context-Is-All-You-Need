      <body>Martha! I'm sorry I didn't respond to your email yet. I have been trying to figure out my schedule before I told you something that would change. I have grad school group work tomorrow morning, then have to do some wedding stuff for two friends' weddings, and need to be in Faribault by early evening. :( I don't have specific times but will let you know if there are gaps tomorrow!! When do you leave?</body>
