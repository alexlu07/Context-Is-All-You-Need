      <body>Hey there! Congrats on graduating! :) Are you going to be home at all this week so I can see you, or are you back at rwu for awhile? Also, if you happen to be home this Friday, would you have any interest in helping me load the moving truck Friday afternoon/evening for $8/hr? My dad says he's "getting old" or something and we could use help :P</body>
