      <body>Hi Gabi I can't meet this morning but I wanted to give you my thought about venue. I think the church might be good for a show or two on the 9th and 10th but to do all our shows without booze makes me nervous. Especially on scandalous nights but even regular nights, the bar is part of the experience. </body>

      <body>Cool, thanks Emma, I want us to keep all our contois dates for that reason too, but i dont see any other viable options that will let us fully present the same show with light, sound, and enough room on the other nights</body>

      <body>I think it's too risky to make that big of a change without testing it first </body>

      <body>I'm also really skeptical that the church would give us free reign to be scandalous. That seems totally bizarre</body>
