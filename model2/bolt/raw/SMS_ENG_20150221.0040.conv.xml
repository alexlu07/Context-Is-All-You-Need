      <body>Why does dad have to stress me out?!?? I'm directing 2 fucking projects in 3 fucking days from start to finish. I'm running on 1 hour of sleep. I broke down at 3 am and cried for a straight 30 minutes. I have a midterm paper due Monday. I'm trying to get a job. And now he tells me we can't fucking pay for school and if I want to keep going I have to find more scholarships. Its impossible for me not to have a seizure at this point. </body>
