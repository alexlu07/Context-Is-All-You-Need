      <body>How was your ethics class at tech? How is ethics as a subject?</body>

      <body>Ethics at tech was cool but mostly a joke. Ethics as a class is cool, you study morality and values and stuff. It can be kinda boring especially when you're reading the greeks, but try to look at the big picture. You usually study Aristotle, Kant, Nietzche and some more modern postmodernist guys. Get ready for round two of your favorite word- deontology!</body>
