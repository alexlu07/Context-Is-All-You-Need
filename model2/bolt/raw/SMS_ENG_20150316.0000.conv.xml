      <body>Okay. Hopefully she returns it. I feel like they miss it on purpose to see what you have to say. Like when I called Steph to let her know about my offer from Gap.</body>

      <body>Phew. She got back to me. She was on vacation last week too that's why she didn't call. But she said within the next two weeks they'll have a decision. They have at least one other interview coming up. I think there was one before me too. She said she's still interested and that I'm not out of the running.</body>
