      <body>My mom said say you at the festival,  I was working though. Meant to text ypu on your bday but I did a 12-hour shift that day and can't have my phone on me or else that's immediate termination so slipped my mind. Im working 7 days a week so its exhausting lol, but hope all is well on your end.</body>
