      <body>Ohhhh okay we have clarified. I thought you meant the lever didn't exist in the first place. Both the other guy and I stood outside by the pump- is it just illegal to get in the car while its pumping?</body>

      <body>Idk. In a lot of places the lever actually DOESN'T exist, but some keep it installed I guess. I don't think it makes a difference if you get back in the car.</body>
