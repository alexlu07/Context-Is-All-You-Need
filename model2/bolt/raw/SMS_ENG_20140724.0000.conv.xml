      <body>I don't know what to do. I wanted to go out,  but now I don't know if that's wrong to do. My aunt Perky's having something at her house tonight but I don't want to go to that either.</body>

      <body>It's not wrong for wanting to go out. And its ok if you don't go to your aunt's house tonight. You weren't extremely close with your aunt and you'll be attending the funeral. And its ok if you don't do either and just stay in. You know that's fine by me at least. Don't feel guilty if you choose to go out with friends tonight. Everyone knows you care.</body>
