      <body>It's official...I hate Sam's boyfriend. The mothereffer ditched her for her bday! He made her change which nifty fifties they go to, and acted like picking her up FOR HER BDAY was a huge inconvenience. He then told her that he would meet her there, but at that point she told him to forget about it. Instead of trying to talk to her into going, he said okay and never talked to her for the rest of the night. She Michael and Eden went somewhere else </body>
