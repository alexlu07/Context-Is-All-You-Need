      <body>ï¿¼Hey man, what do you think I should do about this? Do you think I can just patch it or do I have to replace the whole piece of drywall?</body>

      <body>Is it drywall or plaster? I would probably fill it in with durabond and then finish it with joint compound, prime and paint</body>

      <body>It's drywall, the leak has been fixed as far as I can tell and there is only a very small spot of mold which you can see in the pic. Thanks for your advice, I think that's what I'll do. Anything I should watch out for?</body>
