      <body>Kate, big thanks/ you're awesome to you and tommy for making this such a fun trip and giving some old (and new) pals a great time together. Thanks for giving up your living room for a week to a scruffy fella from the other side of the country. You and tommy were the most hospitable and were wonderful ambassadors to LA. Hope our paths cross again and of course, best of luck with little Pearl! Much love, ######</body>
