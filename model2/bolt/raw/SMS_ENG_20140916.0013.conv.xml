      <body>Brian wrangled his cousin to keep it cheap. We could use another hand but it's just grunt work so it's only budgeted for $15/hr. We'll be framing next week though. So if you can do 2 or 3 days in a row you can make $25/hr for those days. </body>

      <body>Ok. I'd try to get someone else for next week because I really need to work in getting my show together. Next week is my last week of classes to. So I could only do Wednesday and Friday.   After that I only work Monday and Tuesday, but I also need time to get my art ready for  oct9 install date</body>

      <body>Yeah, it's no problem. I'll run the framing crew if you can't. I'd like some time off but I don't really need it and figured that's a role where you can get paid for your experience. There's also a bunch of trim and finish carpentry so maybe when that gets closer we can schedule you for that stuff. </body>
