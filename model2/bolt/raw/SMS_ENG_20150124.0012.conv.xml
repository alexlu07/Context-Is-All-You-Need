      <body>I called my brother-in-law to ask him to look at it but I haven't heard from him. He's probably busy with work because it's the weekend. Want to see what he suggests I should do. I wouldn't even know where I should get a new tire. I wonder if that's covered into warranty. Ayyyyyy. </body>
