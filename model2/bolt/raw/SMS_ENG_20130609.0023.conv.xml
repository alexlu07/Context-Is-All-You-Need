      <body>Hey, happy pride! Would you happen to know of any good places to eat or less standard touristy things to see in Boston?</body>

      <body>Hey! Umm honestly a lot of the things I do are pretty touristy. For walking around, the common and the public gardens are good (I love to sit in the public gardens). Also Copley Square and Newbury Street, which has shops that are fun if expensive. For eating, I honestly go to the marketplace (Quincy Market), but I have to fight off tourists. There are restaurants all around that area, not just the big food court. You could also go into Harvard Square in Cambridge by taking the red line from Park Street (or just look on a T map but it is on the red line).</body>
