      <body>I got the plumbing tools.  Do you have any use for that 4x6" steel posts from I house?  I am going to sell or scrap them if not. They would make a beefy window or door lintel for sure</body>

      <body>Hey, if you can bring those iron posts up from the basement I will pick them up at 8am tomorrow. I may be able to use one for a window. I'll keep the rest if you want and if you need one  or more later you can have them. </body>
