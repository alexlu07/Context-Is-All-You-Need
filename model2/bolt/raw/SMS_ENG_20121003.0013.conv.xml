      <body>I had some great times with you, but I don't see things going anywhere and I don't have time for just hanging In between.  To tell you the truth I'm still a little scarred from being locked out of your place naked for an hour and arriving to your place with no sheets on the bed.  I just feel like everything was an omen from a bad night.  </body>
