      <body>Hi Gabi. I just need to vent. I don't know if I can be stage manager again this year...this burlesque thing is bringing back memories of how stressful it was for me last year. There's no communication at all! Ok that's it for now. I knew you were awake since you emailed...</body>

      <body>Thanks Gabi. I know I'm being a pooper. You're right I should lay the smack down. I've been stage manger for long time and it was never like this - last year was a stress festival - so yeah maybe I should make some communication guidelines. Ok :)</body>
