      <body>Hey! I talked to Jill last night and I was just at the barn - he has 3 blankets on at the moment (not sure whose?) and seems fine today, but it's warmer out. I actually brought out my hood but none of his blankets seemed to have the hooks to attach it. Tanya said she's going to check for him too, maybe check in with her? </body>
