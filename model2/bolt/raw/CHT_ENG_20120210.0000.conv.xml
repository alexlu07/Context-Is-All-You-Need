      <body>Don't worry about it. It wasn't awkward for me. They are both cranky lately for different reasons, but believe me it has nothing to do with you. ##### is lonely, ##### is lonely and have no energy because of this stupid diet. So they are both a less than enthusiastic and never have any energy. I should of taking my own car to be honest.</body>
