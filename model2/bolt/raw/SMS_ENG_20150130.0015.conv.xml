Mom is also freaking out cause there's a police complaint/incident report in my sisters purse. Lord knows what she's been doing. </body>

      <body>I know! I don't know what she was doing. My mom is probably having a mini crisis in her head. I don't think it's anything either...probably because she threw up outside vs. inside. 
It's annoying though because she's so out of it that she didn't want to take a shower...I smell her! Haha. She's gonna be pretty hung over tomorrow from the sounds of it. </body>
