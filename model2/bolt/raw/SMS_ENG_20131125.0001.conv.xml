      <body>Really productive so far. Woke up and went jogging with Jo. Got my teeth cleaned and eyes checked out. The doctor loved looking at my lattice degeneration (thinning retina)-she said it is really pronounced for someone my age, and it is quite fascinating to look at. Hitting the books now.</body>
