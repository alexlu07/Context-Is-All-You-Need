      <body>Hey hunter! I have a project at work that I want to build an 8 by 10 arbor (a pergola) next to and I have been looking at kits from Home Depot but I just thought oh maybe hunter and michael would want to do this from scratch, which would look better. I think my budget is 2000, you'd have to supply the wood. Maybe you and Michael are really busy right now, in which case, don't worry about it, i can get a kit! Just thought it might be cool to hire a friend if that budget sounds like it would be worth it to you.</body>

      <body>Hey Geraldine. We're very busy right now.  I'm pretty sure I could do it for 2 grand depending on size and material and level of detail. But I'm not sure when I have a break. Maybe in a week or so I would have a break but for the next week I'm working 730 am to 6pm m-f so I am too exhausted to do it on the weekend. </body>
