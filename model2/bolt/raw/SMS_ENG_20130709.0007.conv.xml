      <body>Cause the bridesmaids dress is $200 plus another hundred for alterations. Then we have to pay for the bridal shower and the bachelorette party and hair and makeup and gifts for every event. Shit is wild. </body>

      <body>Well I mean, at least you don't have a bridal party, that's one less expense. But it's crazy. Plus the money I lose for taking off all these weekends to do this stuff is a killer for me</body>
