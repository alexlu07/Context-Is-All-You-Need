      <body>I appreciate your understanding of late responses. So after yet another week, how are things for you? </body>

      <body>Endured.  And even not without its joys.  How was your week?  Did you have a snow day yesterday?  </body>

      <body>Mine was tolerable to say the least. No snow day at NYU... I'm convinced we wouldn't stop if the rapture started and plagues ran rampant. Did you get a day off? </body>

      <body>Hahaha.  Ever unflinching before the edge of doom.  Everything was cancelled for me.  Both Fordham and the high school where I work sometimes like to immediately cease all operations at the first sign of snow.  Any new or exciting film projects this weekend?</body>

      <body>What I wouldn't do for a break like that. I've got a festival tonight then I start right back up on a new set Saturday morning. Not that I'm complaining, I love what I do, but I'm 87% certain there might be a world outside of film I'm missing. </body>

      <body>Aaaaaaha.  The old 13% uncertainty that there is no world outside art...</body>

      <body>Is that such a common thing? </body>

      <body>Perhaps not the 13% bit (though that seems a fair estimate)</body>

      <body>Well I'd question your appreciation for the arts, but I know you've been to the Met at least once and that must count for something. </body>

      <body>Oh my...I've probably given you the wrong idea.  </body>

      <body>To return (if you will) to reality, are you ever free on weekends?</body>

    <message id="m0011" time="2015-03-06 23:33:27 UTC" participant="153848">
      <body>I'm free most weekend usually... Sundays are  typically my day off but these past couple of weeks have been odd.</body>
