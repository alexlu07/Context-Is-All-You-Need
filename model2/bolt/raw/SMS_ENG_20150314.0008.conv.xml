      <body>Yes. Also, I never said all Palestinians are terrorists and Avery is an ass to make that straw man argument and claim I said that. I never even said that America shouldn't accept Palestinians from refugee camps. I was pointing out the hypocrisy of expecting Israelis to live under an Arab/Palestinian nation when every other country won't even accept them in our borders bc they are afraid of them.</body>
