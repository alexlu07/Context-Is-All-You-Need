      <body>I found 2 leaks, both of which were fixed pretty easily.  That doesn't mean that there aren't other leaks. The lead drain line and bottle trap are very old and should be replaced at some point. Also the shut-offs in the access panel should probably be 1/4 turn valves rather than spigot valves with bleeds. One if the valves was leaking but I tightened it down and it appears to be ok.  The fittings in the faucet were the other thing that was leaking</body>
