      <body>On my way to work, I was looking up Italian people who took the DNA test and their results. They were confused why they were a small percentage Italian (one was only 13%). Someone broke it down saying southern Italians are a hodgepodge. If the test says "Eastern European" it's most likely reporting Albanian ancestry. If it says "British Isles" it could be because the British traded with Sicily and you have British soldier ancestry.</body>

      <body>It says that the test might even report an "Unknown" percentage because Sicilian ethnicity confuses the algorithm.</body>
