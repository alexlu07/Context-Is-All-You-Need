      <body>My priorities for this weekend are- getting drywall, hanging it, hanging cabinets (my dad will help me with all that).  Doing all the tile in my mom's bathroom (stones come in today) (her and I both have off Monday, so we could do it then at the latest).  Then if socializing fits in, awesome.  and Gowtham has been buggin me about a movie...I could push him off for a few days.</body>

      <body>I thought about the bbq thing, and I realized that it may not be where you are at right now (being around a bunch of virtual strangers, etc.) so then I thought that since I wanted to go to camp, that it would be more fitting for you to get away from the city.</body>

      <body>Im with ya on that, but I will be driving near your place anyway and I don't really mind driving.  helping with renovations is something I enjoy and I feel that if it helps you out and frees up some of your time then it's worth the investment.  I don't expect anything in return, it's just my way of showingmy appreciation for you company :-)</body>
