      <body>I will wait to hear from you then. We have couple of small things going on. On Sunday we have to Skype my brother at 5pm which we can do from anywhere. On Saturday Soraya's friends are going to come to our house and sing for my mom in the afternoon. It would be great if you could come to this mini event. We don't have air conditioning downstairs, but many fans. She has not specified the exact time yet.</body>
