      <body>Things actually got moved around. And luckily it did because there was too many things happening this week. My friend decided to move her birthday stuff next weekend so that she could go visit her boyfriend in D.C. I ended up heading out with another friend because I told her I was going to do something with her, and it ended up being this weekend. While i had to babysit in the meantime. How were the seminars?</body>
