      <body>She was about to cancel her colonoscopy appointment because she didn't have somebody to take her there and back she needed to get that done. They don't let you drive yourself after that because they sedate you. She called John's mother and asked her for a ride but it was supposed to be snowing up there today and John's mother said if it's snowing she wouldn't be able to take her. This is all on Monday</body>

      <body>I reminded her that she has state insurance and the state will provide transportation to any medical appointment that she needs that is covered through insurance.

      <body>But we got it straightened out and the guy picked her up at 6:30 this morning and hopefully dropped her back off at home at two this afternoon before the girls got back from school. So the girls may have been home alone without a phone to call somebody I'm just frustrated</body>
