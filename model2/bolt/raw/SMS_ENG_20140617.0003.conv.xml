      <body>Liz! You don't have a voicemail set up! I'm so sorry I've been MIA. I know you're super busy but I'll call again tomorrow; the picture of Lillian is beautiful-thank you so much for sending it- and I miss you and I'd love to meet her if I'm allowed/she is ready. I'll talk to you tomorrow hopefully.</body>
