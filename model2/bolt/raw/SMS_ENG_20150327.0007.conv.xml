      <body>Ok!  So I have recovered slightly from the  onslaught of family- including my inlaws being here for 11 days!  Do you want to come over Monday? And do you need maternity clothes?</body>

      <body>I don't need anything at all but I definitely want company. I'd love to come Monday. I have no idea if I'm having a boy or a girl yet but I'm 16/17 weeks I guess if I do the math since 14week sonogram. We are so excited! I'm mainly exhausted all of the time because there is so much to do. How are you?</body>
