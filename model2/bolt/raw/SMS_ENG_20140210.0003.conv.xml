      <body>Ha! We need to have drinks soon. It's my fault, I haven't been able to hang out with anyone lately. Can we look ahead to March and try to get something on the books?</body>

      <body>Sure! But if we are looking that far ahead, want to try for dinner too? Say Doma or Figs or Blue Cat?</body>
