      <body>Hahahahaha it's all a big joke. The government is closed for a  snow day so the only entrance to the NIH campus that was open was the commercial vehicle entrance. There were only 5 people here and only one from the bipolar lab...but it's okay because I met the anxiety higher-ups and I'm going to Skype with the RAs</body>

      <body>It's not all that stressful :P I think I'm gonna stay here, yeah. The roads aren't awful but in 2.5 hours it could get worse, and I don't want to risk it. I already canceled everything anyway and I might as well hang out with Gesine :)</body>
