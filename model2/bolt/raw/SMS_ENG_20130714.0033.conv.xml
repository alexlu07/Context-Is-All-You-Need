      <body>Coast is clear. Maman is at Wallace's now. She will stay till 4 or if you want a little later. I had to park the car at the train station. Between the bank and looking for my wallet and contacting Soraya all morning I had no time left to walk to the station. Also I could only deposit the $250 but there was a misunderstanding with Soraya and I couldn't get her PIN number. I think I will do that tomorrow. </body>

      <body>I had to send a group text to all her friends and some of their moms to find her. She slept over at Rachel's and I am assuming she is still there sleeping. She keeps saying "go away" and does not respond to most of my messages. She is very angry. She has to go to her therapist today. I left her train tickets on the chest. I am hoping she will show up in time. The last I heard from Rachel was that she was alone over there. Everyone is at work etc. you could always drive over and wake her up.

      <body>There is a problem with the kids insurance. Soraya is running out of contact lenses. She has enough to last her one week. She is wearing her last pair now. I called the eye dr to get a small batch to hold her over. They said that they absolutely cannot do that at all. They said that she was due for an eye exam two months ago and they cannot give her any contacts without an eye exam. This is by law. So... The exam alone costs $180 and they couldn't tell me how much the lenses will cost for one month supply. I called  CHIP they said that a determination letter was sent out LAST week (which I never received) at a cost of $270.35 per child. They also said that we could appeal it later. She said they can resend the letter of illegibility. I said we don't want to wait. She said we can send a check only (or money order). It will take weeks before the effective date will be given. I am worried we won't make the date for Vassar. I am going to call the congressman and appeal to them. Meanwhile Soraya needs lenses and we have to do the exam and order them latest Monday. What do we do?</body>

      <body>Yes she had glasses but they are very ugly. I bought the cheapest ones possible to wear at home. I think she will be very upset if we tell her to go without lenses. Yesterday she was extremely unhappy counting all the 'things' she has been losing recently.
