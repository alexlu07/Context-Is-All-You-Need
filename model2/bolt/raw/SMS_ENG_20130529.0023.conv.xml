      <body>Well, this is the time when I would ask you for May's rent, but since you barely used the space, it seems a little odd. Maybe you could just throw some bucks in the funtimes box anytime you use the space?</body>

      <body>That would be cool. I only used it once for under an hour.. If I don't use it much over the next few weeks I can return the key or just put a lil cash in there whenever I do use it. I dot know which one is the fun times box tho</body>
