      <body>Hey jeremy,this may be uneccasary but i caught  the caution on your face,hope you have a good event, i partialy sleep deprived and hung over please humor my sensitivity please. I got  a text from erik saying how cool it was to run into you and i feel a weird and intense energy from him that doesnt agree with me,and i believe you guys prob picked up on it too. I try to make friends with most people and feel somewhat repelled by him and doesn't help that he may have a crush on me somewhat... Just hope you don't misplace any wierdness with me :( I don't feel nice expressing that but please humor ,wishing the best, have fun</body>
