      <body>I love you so much Martha. I know you'll be ok. Its just really stressful right now.  Just remember to take one thing at a time and that if you make a mistake apologize and move on.you're very smart and more than competent. You are ok.  In the next couple of days well talk again and then you can make some decisions. I love you.
