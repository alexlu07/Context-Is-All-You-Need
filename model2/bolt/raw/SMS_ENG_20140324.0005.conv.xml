      <body>Hey, what do you think of dropping by my house first for coffee and doing work here for a bit? We could go to Penn if we still want to do work there. I just tend to have better luck finding parking there later in the afternoon around four or five. Call me later and let me know (maybe around 11?). </body>

      <body>Hey, so you just got an email from me that probably doesn't make sense right now. After sending my résumé to you, I checked the attachment and it looked fine. It didn't duplicating itself on both sides. This unfortunately means that it's my laptop. I'm trying to wait it out to but it keeps changing back to make two identical columns so I'm giving up and going to bed. The odd thing is, when I see it in "print preview", it's the duplicated version. Hopefully, this will be remedied tomorrow/today. If not, it might be a sign that this job already doesn't want me.</body>
