      <body>so many things! i got a couple packages in the mail, painted my nails perfectly, and woke up to a text from andrew saying that he'd obtained a car for this weekend, which was something he was concerned about. plus we got 3rd place at trivia just the four of us, and i contributed a lot! also it was someone's birthday on one of the other teams and they gave everyone good humor bars. and i finished watching weeds! </body>

      <body>right. the two of us were awesome. i just couldn't stand to see him unhappy and worried. if he puts his all into monogamy with her and it fails, he knows where i am. but i hope whatever makes him happiest works itself out.</body>
