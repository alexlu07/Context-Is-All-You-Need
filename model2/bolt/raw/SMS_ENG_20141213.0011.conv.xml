      <body>Nothing close by. They set it up that way so you're stuck buying overpriced food. If you have enough time beforehand there's a Wawa with a parking lot on Columbus Blvd, and from there you can get down to the stadiums pretty easily. But you'd have to take 95 south instead of 76 to get there. You're probably better off just bringing something along </body>

      <body>One other option: I'm pretty sure there's a Wawa in Conshohocken. So when you get off 476 to go to 76, you'd go right and follow the sign for Conshohocken instead, then make a right at the traffic light. I think it's at the top of the little hill there. Then you'd just head for 76E like usual. A little closer anyway! </body>
