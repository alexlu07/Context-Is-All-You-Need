      <body>Well, Jacob said he was having a ruff day earlier and I suggested a phone call convo, because it has been so good for you and I and such. And we are supposed to talk tonight, or maybe will now because I texted him to ask about which time zone he was talking about and... </body>

      <body>No no no no you're not. Jake's clearly in a pickle right now. Tiffany really messed him up and if he's going back into her crazy cycle than that's on him. Hopefully he knows better than that, and will talk to you. </body>

      <body>But if he lets himself be puppeteered by her again then that's just stupid and someone needs to slap him. Because we're all just friends who support each other and save each other from ourselves. Right? </body>

      <body>Yeah, I wish you guys would have really laid down the law with Logan before the second time lol, but yes I really do hope that he makes the right decision.... The worst part is, Jacob and I haven't talked about that other girl really since I first got back from break... And that worries me about the Tiffany thing </body>

      <body>Dollface I wish I had known just how badly I needed to keep Logan in his place. But you're so strong and you made it through seeing him again. I know you're stronger than anything this situation could throw at you. Now he hasn't mentioned Tiffany or the other girl at all before to you? </body>

      <body>The other girl, only time he mentioned her was towards the beginning of getting back.. I encouraged him to go after her, but I haven't heard about her since. Tiffany I have heard about/ I even asked about.. And advised against </body>
