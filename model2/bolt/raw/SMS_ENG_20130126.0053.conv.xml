      <body>Eek, it should be 8, cuz if we put 8 the crowd will show up at 9, if we put 9 the crowd will show up at 10, and its a monday night so we cant expect people to be out that late.  I believe last year it was at 8 no?</body>

      <body>I like your thinking, but better check with Lois. It might depend on when we can actually let people in the door. She told me 9. It probably depends on when we can actually get in there after muddys closes and how much time we meed to set up. We should really all be clear with a time and stick with it so confusion doesn't happen. Or check with folks before changing something. </body>
