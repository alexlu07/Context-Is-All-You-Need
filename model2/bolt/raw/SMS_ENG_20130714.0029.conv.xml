      <body>I couldn't sleep. Just dozing off here and there...feeling tired with a slight headache from all that crying. Friends have been calling and emailing...wanting to know how the drama unfolded!!! I felt I had to talk to everyone and I am tired from that too...I'll come over once I perk up a little. If I don't maybe I fell asleep. Thanks for asking.</body>
