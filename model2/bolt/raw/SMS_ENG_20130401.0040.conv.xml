      <body>I signed him up for the medical alert but I don't have his mailing address. He was supposed to send it to me along with a list of things he needs from our garage. I haven't received anything yet. Do you have my dad's address? Also what telephone numbers do I use for emergency contacts? They said that they can be updated at any time 24/7.</body>
