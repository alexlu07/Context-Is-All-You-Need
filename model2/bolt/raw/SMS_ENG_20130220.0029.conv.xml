      <body>Looks like Danielle and I both have off today.  Since I surprisingly got the day off I'm thinking about leaving here earlier than planned to get some other stuff done too, then head to the auction from there since we'll be closer. If you guys still wanna buy some stuff at the auction would you wanna meet us there on yr own schedule? Ooorr....? Whacha thinkin?</body>
