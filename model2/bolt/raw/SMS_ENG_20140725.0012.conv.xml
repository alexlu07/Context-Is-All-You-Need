      <body>how about Sunday? we actually just pulled in up in Scranton for a funeral first thing in the morning, but we'll be back tomorrow night. 
I've heard people say they've gone to pretty boy and just hiked to really out of the way spots to avoid the cops, then there's the gunpowder river and a place we went to a couple times last year called hammerman beach that's in a state park where the little rivers start connecting to meet the bay. pretty tame water wise which is why we started going there with zozo. so several options, maybe I can get in touch when we get back to make a plan. </body>
