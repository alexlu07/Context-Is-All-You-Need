      <body>I hated ccp when I started but then it wasn't so bad.. I hated Drexel even more than ccp. After two years I still didn't like it but it wasn't as bad as when I started. It all came down to I didn't get involved while on campus.  I commuted so didn't make friends bec I was home and I worked so had to leave campus immediately rather than hanging out</body>
