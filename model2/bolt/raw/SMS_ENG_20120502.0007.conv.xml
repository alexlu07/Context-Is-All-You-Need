      <body>I sent these pics to Peter an hour ago but he didn't respond. Which do you like for Bens coat? They are at I Goldberg, I'd like to leave center city with something so I don't have to come back up here. I like that last one best.￼￼￼￼</body>

      <body>While I'm impressed that you are still doggedly pursuing Ben's coat, I think that it's probably okay to let it go. There was a development earlier today. You can also not worry about the pamphlets. We'll get back to you tonight. </body>
