      <body>Hey Miss Gracki! So I was trying to think of which peeps would be interested in setting up a table with the vendors at 1st Friday to sell some of our goods. Figured I'd give you first dibs. Would you be interested at all?   ...its free.    Lauren (and whoever else you'd like) is welcome also, of course.</body>

      <body>Cool. Its nothing big or spectacular or anything. Pretty much like doing gorilla street vending. Nothing formal. Just pick a good/foot trafficked spot on the street, throw down a table, and sell our shit to the people walkin on by for all the First Friday art openings...</body>
