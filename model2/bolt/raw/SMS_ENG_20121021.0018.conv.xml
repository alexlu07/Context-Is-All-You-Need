      <body>Hi Bailey! How are you doing? Can't wait to see you next weekend! I've been searching for some kind of part time/odd job to save up some extra cash, but I've had no luck. Do you know of anything I can do near campus, or anything you need done around the house? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you and see you soon!</body>

      <body>Hi Will. Glad to hear from you and will look forward to seeing you soon. Regarding work, do you have any transportation? I have a friend in Va Highlands who may need some help. I may need some things done around house too. Will think about it. </body>
