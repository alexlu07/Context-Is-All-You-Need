      <body>Well it all worked out in the end. I just felt bad that the little doe had to suffer so long.  It's something I'd like to do maybe once a year to have some non industrial meat, but I definitely prefer fishing</body>

      <body>I hear ya man, how long did she live after the gut shot?   Got a decent doe this weekend, but I've wounded and lost 2 in the last year. Bad feeling. I've started doing neck shots. So far so good. She dropped like a stone on the corn and bled out in less than a minute </body>
