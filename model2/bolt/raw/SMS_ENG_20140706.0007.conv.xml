      <body>So next Sunday should be good for the barn! Would you be up for a half hour lesson? It'd be $25. My friend seems more up for that rather than turning us loose with her pony :)</body>

      <body>If you get here around 4-430, that'll give us plenty of time for a beer/tour and then to go ride. This'll be fun!</body>
