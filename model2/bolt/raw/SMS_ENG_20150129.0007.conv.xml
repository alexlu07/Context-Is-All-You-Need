      <body>Hi Julia! :-) I will be able to do something tomorrow but it won't be until the afternoon. I've decided to go back to working on Friday mornings, so that my days are not so long Monday through Thursday. So I probably could do something around three or 330, let me know if that works for you :-)</body>

      <body>Ok! I can't do afternoon tomorrow (that should work for future lessons though) but Monday would be great, what time? I think it might be super cold that day is the only thing. Thanks! :)</body>
