      <body>Okay. Haha. I called the people at Green Bay about the jersey cause I was going to be #90 but then I noticed that I never changed it and it was still at 0. Haha. The lady said if I spent $100 it'd be free shipping, which was an extra $10. The jersey was $95. She told me to get an  ornament so I did. And she gave me 20% off the ornament so my grand total was less than my original total...and I got an ornament. </body>

      <body>And I changed it to #23. I told him that mommy was playing the lottery and he had to pick a number between 1-99. He picked 23. I asked if it was his favorite number and he said no but that it was a gut feeling. I just went with it. </body>

      <body>Me too!!!!! She asked if I wanted to look online to see if I liked it and I was like "no that's okay...I think I'll like it based off the name!" I do think she gave me 20% because I made maddie and sid talk to her on the phone. </body>
